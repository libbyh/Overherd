His restaurants, Frontera Grill and Topolobampo, are excellent for lunch or for dinner, but you just have to understand the situation regarding prices, reservations, etc. Topolobampo accepts reservations on Opentable.com (as well as over the phone) like most restaurants. They open the book three months in advance, and dinner reservations fill up quickly shortly after that, so it's tough to get one with short notice. At lunchtime, reservations fill up a few weeks in advance, so you can find them more easily than at dinner. Frontera Grill accepts only a handful of reservations and only over the phone, and keeps most of the dining room available for walk-in customers. As a result, you can expect to encounter long waits (one to two hours) at Frontera Grill unless you arrive 15-20 minutes before they open the doors. Also, Topolobampo is a lot more expensive than Frontera Grill at dinnertime, but the prices are very similar for lunch. I think Topolobampo is a great option for lunch, if you can get a reservation. For dinner, if you don't have a reservation and you don't want to eat early at Frontera, I would go elsewhere - more about that in a moment. I'm not all that impressed with XOCO, Bayless's third restaurant (all in the same location); the food is good but, unlike Topolobampo and Frontera Grill, it's not all that different from what you can find in cities across the U.S. " /><attribute name="epoch_seconds" value="1302584400" /></branch><branch><attribute name="name" value="message not name" /><attribute name="type" value="message" /><attribute name="message_id" value="6461146" /><attribute name="author" value="chicgail" /><attribute name="message_date" value="2011-04-12 17:30:00" /><attribute name="message_body" value="&#10; I've been to " /><attribute name="epoch_seconds" value="1302584400" /></branch></branch><branch><attribute name="name" value="Sunday Dinner, 1 day in Chicago" /><attribute name="type" value="message" /><attribute name="message_id" value="6460559" /><attribute name="author" value="mlzeats" /><attribute name="message_date" value="2011-04-12 14:16:00" /><attribute name="message_body" value="&#10; I will be arriving in Chicago next  Sunday  morning and will be leaving Monday afternoon.

Do you mean our most expensive (typically $200 or more per person including moderate alcohol and tax/tip), formal (jackets required) high-end restaurants?  If so, some of them are closed Sundays (Everest, Charlie Trotter's, TRU, Avenues) while others are open Sundays (Alinea, Spiaggia).  Given the short notice, Alinea is out of the question, but there's plenty of availability for Spiaggia on Opentable.com  It features Italian cuisine and it's right across the street from the Drake.  Now, if you'd like to consider our more casual, less expensive (more like $100/pp or less) &quot;finer dining&quot; restaurants, most of those are open on Sundays.  One of the best is Cafe Spiaggia, the moderately-priced Italian, sister restaurant next door to Spiaggia - again right across the street from the Drake.  Other excellent restaurants open Sundays within a few blocks of the Drake include bistronomic (contemporary American-French), Le Colonial (French-Vietnamese), Balsan (contemporary American-Mediterranean), and Bistro 110 (French bistro).  If you're willing to walk a little further, let's say about 10-12 minutes, you can also consider Sable (contemporary American with artisanal cocktails) and Salpicon (contemporary Mexican).  All of these are very good indeed.  So, as you can see, there's plenty right within walking distance of the Drake, open Sundays.  The four places you mentioned are indeed all some distance (two miles or more) from the Drake, and not within walking distance.  But if you don't mind taking a cab for a place that's really unique, I'd recommend North Pond (that's its name - not North Point), which is two miles north of the Drake.  It's in the middle of the park (seriously), facing its namesake pond, with the city skyline looming over the opposite shore.  The renovated building formerly served as a warming shelter for ice skaters on the lake.  You can ask for the room facing the pond when making your reservation, but even the inside room with its open kitchen is very special too.  The cuisine is contemporary American from James Beard Award finalist Chef Bruce Sherman.  The other places I'm recommending here are all excellent as well, but North Pond's setting in the park is exquisite and makes it a unique experience.  All of the above accept reservations on Opentable.com where it's easy to see which ones are open and have availability on any particular date and time.

For the last 20 years we've been growing most of the vegetables, fruits and herbs we eat---organically.  What we don't grow, we try to buy at the farmer's market at Peoria's Metro Centre, about 18 miles from our home.  Metro Centre is owned and operated by the brother of Susan G. Komen (name ring a bell?  If not, think pink).  In that shopping center is also an independently-owned store, Naturally Yours.  We do a fair amount of shopping there---they carry many of the organic products we choose to use, including the bread from Peoria Bread Co.  This bread is made by Dave Koehler, my state senator and is made of local, organic wheat.  I also shop at several other locally-owned and -managed stores in Peoria:  Taj Emporium for Indian spices and staples, Cedar's for the whole wheat pitas they make next door, Mediterranean Mart for pomegranate juice, and the International Market, which looks much like the H-mart.    However, one thing we can't find at these local sources is good, organic, crunchy peanut butter without sugar or salt.  We have found such a product at Trader Joe's.  So, twice a year, when we're in St. Louis, we make a trip to Trader Joe's and stock up on peanut butter.  And yes, a few other items usually find their way into our cart.  We usually buy what we think is a 6-month supply of peanut butter, but we goofed last time and are down to our last jar!    We recently decided to take a quick trip up to Naperville, which happens to be the location of the Trader Joe's nearest to our home.  Don't go there too often, hence the request for dining recommendations.  We also plan to go to Whole Foods since it's nearby in the hopes of finding some Neal's Yard stilton.  It makes an excellent omlette with sauteed morels, which we hope to find soon at our friend's wooded property.  So, I guess the question is, can we expect to find Neal's Yard stilton and organic, crunchy, salt- and sugar-free peanut butter at H-mart?

From the moment you walk in until you leave, you just know that you've experienced something unique.  This really isn't a review but more or less an observation - a debriefing of sorts.   That Team Achatz can create a high-end dining experience for $70 a person (we went Thursday night at 6), is amazing. The servers are approachable, knowledgeable about the food and history and attentive. Unlike other  &quot;fancy restaurants&quot;, at Next you actually hear people talking, hear utensils hitting the plates and glass clinking. This is high end dining for the masses - and I mean that in the most complimentary way.   Having just returned from a trip to Spain and eating in some incredible restaurants in San Sebastian (more Michelin stars per capita than anywhere else in the world) and Bareclona (Alikimia is a must), I was anxious to see NEXT would compare. It not only matched the food - but exceeded it with atmosphere and quality of ingredients.  I won't go course by course - I will let someone more versed in food do that, but I will say that the pressed duck was the showstopper. Tender and meaty with a sauce made of cognac and juices from the duck, that course was the one that people will talk about. But equally impressive - and usually harder to pull off - was the dessert course with a cold bombe ceylan with hints of rum and chocolate cookie.   There were also some surprises - especially with the hors d'oeuvres course - so I won't ruin it but expect a surprise with the quail egg.   Again -- food alone doesn't make a great dining experience, it's the atmosphere. At NEXT,  they have not only nailed the food but they have nailed the experience. We are fortunate to have them in our city. &#10;" /><attribute name="epoch_seconds" value="1302238800" /><branch><attribute name="name" value="message not name" /><attribute name="type" value="message" /><attribute name="message_id" value="6449401" /><attribute name="author" value="GastronomyGoddess" /><attribute name="message_date" value="2011-04-08 06:47:00" /><attribute name="message_body" value="&#10; LMG70: I think you have hit on something, which is oftentimes considered a dining faux pas in high-end restaurants, but something that does set Next apart from the El Bulli's of the world -- the vivaciousness of the restaurant itself.

A Chef --in this case, Grant Achatz-- is aware that all senses, not only tastebuds, are on high alert, and he is going to excite and play with each and every one of them. As I was also impressed last night with the energy of the staff and patrons, I agree wholeheartedly with your observation (however, I would also appreciate your round-up of the choice of cuisine). In my opinion, the clinking glasses, the utensils dinging the plates, and the rumble of people talking and laughing are signs of revelry and good times. Not only did Grant and his team find success in bringing the richness and flavors from that time period back to life, but as I overheard a patron last night mention as she clinked her glass in delight, I also think that he channeled the vitality of the bourgeois exceptionally well. &#10;" /><attribute name="epoch_seconds" value="1302238800" /></branch><branch><attribute name="name" value="message not name" /><attribute name="type" value="message" /><attribute name="message_id" value="6449472" /><attribute name="author" value="lmg70" /><attribute name="message_date" value="2011-04-08 07:12:00" /><attribute name="message_body" value="&#10; @gg: i think the staff really added to the experience.

Avenues is an excellent restaurant, but there's virtually no view to be had from the main dining room, with the exception of a single seat. (Unless perhaps you're referring to the view from the small bar seating, with its five or so stools facing the kitchen.)   Avenues is on the north side of the fifth floor of the Peninsula Hotel, facing Chicago Avenue, and only has small windows in alcoves on the north side of the main dining room. Directly across the street is the uninteresting slab facade of the Park Hyatt, which is the view for anyone facing northwest. Those facing northeast (and those turning to that direction) can see the top of the Water Tower, and behind it, the slab of upper floors of Water Tower Place, but not the park or street below.  Because the restaurant is on the fifth floor, you cannot see down to the street unless you are seated directly next to the windows. All the window alcoves, except one, contain two-tops, and the only person who is up against the window and able to look down is facing away from the window - no view unless they're turning around. And even if you turn around, it is impossible to see Michigan Avenue from any of the two-tops; it's obscured by trees and rather far away.  There is a four-top in the window alcove in the northeast corner of the restaurant. From that one table, the person facing southeast has a nice view of the park below to his left, and can see Michigan Avenue behind it. The person facing southwest must turn around for a view. Everyone else has no view of the street below.  If you want a great view, go to Everest (or North Pond or the Signature Room or Sixteen, or NoMI when it reopens as NoMI Kitchen on June 3). Don't expect a great view of the park and street below from Avenues unless they're willing to reserve you the four-top in the northeast corner of the room. &#10;" /><attribute name="epoch_seconds" value="1302584400" /></branch><branch><attribute name="name" value="message not name" /><attribute name="type" value="message" /><attribute name="message_id" value="6459978" /><attribute name="author" value="TAsunder" /><attribute name="message_date" value="2011-04-12 11:36:00" /><attribute name="message_body" value="&#10;" /><attribute name="epoch_seconds" value="1302584400" /></branch><branch><attribute name="name" value="message not name" /><attribute name="type" value="message" /><attribute name="message_id" value="6460008" /><attribute name="author" value="nsxtasy" /><attribute name="message_date" value="2011-04-12 11:43:00" /><attribute name="message_body" value="&#10; North Pond has two main dining rooms.

Very, very lucky indeed - and a great choice!  &gt;&gt; - is the lunch trade at a place like Purple Pig equally busy as dinner or is there a better chance of a walk-in table on a Fri/Sat?  I haven't been there but my understanding is that the long waits are primarily at dinner.  I'm not saying there would be no wait at all at lunchtime, but it shouldn't be terribly long, and it's definitely worth a try.  What makes it even more appealing is the fact that they serve the same menu all day long, so you don't miss out on anything by going at lunch.  The only hesitation I would have is that the Purple Pig and the Publican (where you already have a reservation) are quite similar in their menu and its concentration on pork, charcuterie, cheese, and organ meats.  But if you've looked over both website menus and still feel strongly enough to keep both on your itinerary, then by all means do so!  &gt;&gt; - what I've heard of Cemitas Puebla makes me drool. Is it worth the field trip?  I haven't been there, sorry.  &gt;&gt; I should have mentioned, the Burnham Hotel was like a second home for me for a while when I was traveling often to Chicago a few years ago, so I'm very familiar with Atwood Cafe (which was reliably good).  Then I should point out that Chef Heather Terhune, who ran Atwood Cafe for its first ten years, left there a year or two ago, and now runs Sable, which may be my favorite contemporary American restaurant in the city.

I have been scouring over these boards for a bit now and think I have formulated a good plan of attack on the foods of your city.    A few breakfast/bunch spots I have read about here that look good are the Bongo Room being right around the corner from the hotel.  Cafe des Architectes brunch sampler looks like something worth the trip up (the hotel offers a free shuttle to the Magnificent Mile).  Maybe a nice healthy breakfast of pastry from Fox &amp; Obel.  Still need to find another breakfast, how is XOCO?  As for the Chicago staples of hot dogs, pizza and beefs.  We are looking to hop onto a pizza tour to get a nice sample from the whole city and then sitting down to eat at one of the spots the tour did not get to, be it Uno/Duo, Lou Malnati's, or Giordano's.  A trip to Portillos will get us a traditional Chicago hot dog and an Italian beef.  Id also like to go to Al's since I think they are next to each other.  Is there an original Portillos or Al's that is better then the rest or are they all pretty much run the same?  We also think its worth it to take the long trip + wait to get some interesting combination at Hot Dougs.  We have a few other items on the list that we plan to work into the schedule like Lunches at Topolobampo and XOCO.  A stop at the French Market and possibly Maxwell St Market. Girl &amp; The Goat also seems like it would be a good choice for a dinner.  I would absolutely love to go to Alenia but sadly a $500 dinner would stretch the budget for the weekend thin.  I've put my name in for Next and if I luck out there (Thai street food would be amazing) that could be our splurge.  We would be fine with public transport and also willing to walk quite a bit as long at the weather stays nice but we wont have a car.  Walking would also let us pop into smaller places on the way like Garretts.  I know the taste of Chicago will be going on and as of now its still free to look, I am sure we will snag some small bites there.  On the off chance there is authentic Singapore cuisine somewhere we would love to eat there.  All in all I think ill got a good spread of flavors and hit some of the iconic Chicago foods, just thought Id toss this post up for any extra suggestions or tips, like ordering your deep dish before going, would have never thought of that one.

Incidentally, Bongo Room is close, but not exactly right around the corner; it's three blocks south and one block west.  XOCO is very good for Mexican street food including breakfast, although I think it's still worth trying one of our other places for provincial Mexican food for lunch, dinner, or brunch, such as your planned lunch at Topolobampo.  If this is for a weekend breakfast, you might consider substituting brunch at Mundial Cocina Mestiza or Mexique.  Note that Bongo Room doesn't accept reservations and they get very busy on Sundays; CdA does accept reservations and serves their brunch on Saturdays and Sundays.

I remember that my folks found these an especially exotic take on the usual Lerner's Hotdog, and Paul's was quite the  rage for a while, but to my skeptical tastes, all that superfluous vegetation seemed to be masking a decidedly inferior-quality sausage, and I've been anti garden-dog ever since.    The classic Chicago hot dog I knew from the mid-50's on up was a kosher sausage on a poppy seed bun with yellow mustard, relish, and onions (and never, ever ketchup). Typically the fries were thrown on top of the dog and all wrapped together in white tissue paper to keep everything warm, giving the classic &quot;meal-on-a-bun&quot; arrangement. Later, sport peppers and pickles gained acceptance, but for me, that dreaded salad-on-a-sausage that now passes as a Chicago Style Hot Dog will always bear the same relationship to the real Classic as one of those parasol-bearing, tropical fruit-laden Trader Vic cocktails does to a good glass of scotch. &#10;" /><attribute name="epoch_seconds" value="1302411600" /></branch><branch><attribute name="name" value="message not name" /><attribute name="type" value="message" /><attribute name="message_id" value="2905117" /><attribute name="author" value="GroovinGourmet" /><attribute name="message_date" value="2007-09-02 15:10:00" /><attribute name="message_body" value="&#10; Crinklecuts from a freezer are &quot;THE best&quot;?

 So you want a real &#8220;Chicago hot dog&#8221; right?  Well for the most part you can almost just go by the &quot;brand&quot; they sell instead of &quot;stand&quot; that steams it on this one.  Brands to look for:
1) Vienna Beef
2) Best Kosher
3) Chicago Red Hot  Now my favorite stands:  1) Gene &amp; Jude&#8217;s (this one really stands out, and the fries are hand cut fresh on site)
2) Superdawg (great 50's drive in atmosphere, amazing shakes)
3) Fast Track is a neat place downtown  I&#8217;ll give a very honorable mention to Portillo&#8217;s since any of them are fine, including Downtown, and they really are all over.  Best Kosher, Vienna, Portillo's &amp; Flukie&#8217;s all have their own &#8220;Grocery store&#8221; sausages (usually without the natural casings, but they&#8217;re all very good) if you opt to get packages from the store if you want to take something back home or missed one in particular.  Now for the last thing, I know theses are always fighting words with those rabid Hot Doug&#8217;s fans:   A Chicago hot dog is pure beef!! Any other sausage offering is not a Chicago hot dog, PERIOD! The poster didn&#8217;t ask for Italian, Polish or Brats, they asked for &#8220;Chicago hot dogs&#8221; 
Which means: PURE BEEF sausages, not rabbit, deer, or any other strange meat gourmet combination like what you would get from Hot Doug&#8217;s! Save that one for your &#8220;Wild Chicago&#8221; excursions with locals who want something unique and out of the ordinary. Remember, out of Towner&#8217;s are not here for the oddball variations that bare no resemblance to the original Chicago Style hot dog, they are here for what made the city famous, so don&#8217;t go and get defensive about it, just try to stay on topic.

Ugly's hot dogs in chicagos western suburbs cuz they put the most authentic chicago style ingredients (mustard, neon green relish, onions, tomato, pickle spear, sport pepper and celery salt) on their all beef dogs &amp; they come with fries cut from real potatoes, awesome old hot dog stand type building, amusing character taking the orders and the no ketchup rule is alive and well there because you can't pay them to put it on your dog.&#10;2.  Superdawg cuz their dogs are pretty big, have a distinct flavor, they come with that awesome green pickled tomato and the drive-in theme takes me back to the 50's.&#10;3.

That helps.  With a group of seven, I recommend choosing a restaurant that accepts reservations. That way, you can make a reservation in advance, and you won't be walking in and waiting for a long time until they can set up a table that size.  (So no Bongo Room, sorry!)   Also, price probably won't be much of a factor. Entrees are rarely over $20 at lunch/brunch, almost anywhere (with only a handful of exceptions).  Good places in the West Loop that accept reservations and are open for lunch/brunch on Sundays include Wishbone and Prairie Fire, both serving American food. In the South Loop, you've got Custom House Tavern (American), Mercat a la Planxa (tapas), Zapatista (Mexican), Chicago Curry House (Indian), and Amarit (Thai), although it sounds like these last four may be too far &quot;out there&quot;.  Personally, I think some of the very best Sunday brunch food on the planet is at our creative provincial Mexican restaurants, such as Salpicon in Old Town, Mexique in West Town, and Mundial Cocina Mestiza in Pilsen, all of which are just 2-3 miles from UIC. However, if Greek food may be too &quot;out there&quot; for your group, I'm guessing that Mexican would be, too.  If that's the case, then I think Wishbone, Prairie Fire, or Custom House Tavern would be perfect for your needs.  Here are links to the brunch/lunch menus for the above places:  Wishbone - " /><attribute name="epoch_seconds" value="1302411600" /></branch><branch><attribute name="name" value="message not name" /><attribute name="type" value="message" /><attribute name="message_id" value="6454842" /><attribute name="author" value="nsxtasy" /><attribute name="message_date" value="2011-04-10 15:45:00" /><attribute name="message_body" value="&#10; P.S. Note that most of these places have a special brunch menu, which includes breakfast dishes like eggs and pancakes as well as lunch dishes like sandwiches and salads.  Whereas Amarit and Chicago Curry House (and Greek Islands) have the same dinner menu all the time, with no breakfast dishes on it.  So if you think some in your group would prefer the availability of breakfast dishes, you might want to go with one of the places that has a menu specifically for brunch. &#10;" /><attribute name="epoch_seconds" value="1302411600" /></branch><branch><attribute name="name" value="message not name" /><attribute name="type" value="message" /><attribute name="message_id" value="6455106" /><attribute name="author" value="hungrymidge" /><attribute name="message_date" value="2011-04-10 17:43:00" /><attribute name="message_body" value="&#10; Excellent.

One thing to consider is the ability of various foods to travel, and how long items purchased will keep in transit.  Depending on how you're traveling, there may be portions of the trip where refrigeration (an actual refrigerator or just a cooler full of ice) isn't available, and some items will keep better than others.  Even non-refrigerated items like popcorn and bread won't last forever, although you can extend their freshness by bringing heavy duty ziploc bags with you on your trip.  All of this is true regardless of where you buy things.  When I go to Fox &amp; Obel, I buy an assortment of items.  I rarely buy packaged goods they get from elsewhere, although that's certainly a possibility and those items would likely travel just fine.  Most of the breads made at F&amp;O will travel fine without refrigeration; my favorites include their cinnamon swirl rolls, bran muffins, rustic fruit and nut loaf, and brioche loaf, all of which IMHO are the best you'll find anywhere and are worth bringing back as long as you plan to consume them within a few days.  Some of the desserts and pastries at the bakery counter require refrigeration for any length of time, such as the bread pudding, chocolate brut, and various tarts.  Virtually all of the food from the prepared foods counter would require refrigeration; you may be able to get by without it a little while for certain items such as smoked meats and smoked fish.  Things like sandwiches, salads, and soups all require refrigeration (and soups wouldn't be allowed in carry-on luggage on airplanes).  Note that some of these items requiring refrigeration would still last a few hours without it, long enough so that if you bought them to consume on a plane flight, they would survive the trip to the airport and the wait before boarding.

The vegan chocolate cake is my favorite ever.  Of course there are some good restaurants in Wilmette, Evanston, and closer to the city, but those are the ones I can think of near Deerfield. Of course (and some Chow members will disagree, as usual), I would urge you to stop by Deerfield Bakery.

FWIW, I'm not particularly fond of Bob Chinn's, as I find their preparations rather uninspired and often overly dependent on garlic to the exclusion of any other flavorings. Granted, the seafood there is always fresh. I just find Mitchell's way better.  &gt;&gt; Jimmy's Charhouse is near there too and Wildfire and Tramanto's, but I would not particularly opt for them over the 'legit' nice restaurants (esp Michael in Winnetka) that nsxtasy mentioned below--if you want an upscale dinner.  Thanks - I think it all depends on what you're looking for. The contemporary American and French places I mentioned are extraordinarily good, and unusually creative. Michael and Inovasi are my two favorite restaurants in the Chicago area, the places I keep going back to again and again when I want to show off the best we've got. But if you're just looking for a good steak - and there's nothing wrong with that - then all of these (along with Morton's and Ruth's Chris, in Northbrook) are good recommendations, places where you can get an excellent steak. IMHO Carson's is as good as any of these for steaks.  One other place in Wheeling deserves a mention. Cooper's Hawk has a winery in southwest suburban Orland Park, and has three more locations in the Chicago suburbs, including one on Milwaukee Avenue in Wheeling. The wines are very good and so is the food. You can sample any of the wines for free in the tasting room adjoining the restaurant (and of course they're available for purchase). The markups on wine in the dining room are much less than the standard 2.5-3.0 at most restaurants; for example, the Malbec they sell for $20 in the tasting room is only $28 in the restaurant. The food is rather creative American bistro fare. Reservations are strongly recommended.

Make sure you go to Garrett's Popcorn for gourmet popcorn. It is worth the money and the wait.  Also Lou Malnati's is the #1 deep dish. People will advocate for Uno's or Duo's or other places, but really Lou's is the best--in my original North Shore perspective.  If the restaurant at the courtyard of the Art Institute is still open, then consider eating there.  Food Life is OK in a pinch if you are stuck at Water Tower place.  Someone else will have to provide the rest, but enjoy.

Regarding the places for deep-dish pizza, Lou Malnati's, the original Uno and Due, and Pizano's are all great and very similar to each other.  That's no coincidence; Lou Malnati's and Pizano's were both founded by sons of Rudy Malnati Sr. who worked with their dad at Uno and Due in its early decades.  If you're near the northern half of the Mag Mile, Pizano's on State is closest to you; near the southern half, Uno and Due are closer.  (The closest Lou Malnati's is on Wells, a bit further than the others.)   Our specialty in provincial Mexican food is mentioned in that other topic to which twodales provided the link.  However, because of the days you'll be visiting, Frontera Grill and Topolobampo may not be the best choice, since both are closed on Sundays and Mondays, and Saturday is a choice between a horrendous wait at Frontera and probably an entirely booked Topolobampo.  But we also have some other great Mexican places.  Salpicon is near the north end of the Mag Mile and is excellent, open for dinner and Sunday brunch.  Two miles west of the Mag Mile is Mexique, open for lunch, dinner, and Saturday/Sunday brunch.  I'd also consider North Pond, an upscale restaurant serving contemporary American cuisine.  What makes North Pond unique is its exquisite setting in the middle of the park facing its namesake pond, with the city skyline looming over the opposite shore.  It's about two miles from the north end of the Mag Mile, an easy cab ride.  You might also check out Fox &amp; Obel, our premier upscale gourmet food store, near the Mag Mile.  They have the best meats, fish, prepared foods, etc.  Of particular interest for those visiting from out of town is the bakery counter.  The breads are fantastic, which is why it was named by Bon Appetit magazine among the ten best bread bakeries in the United States.  There are lots more places.  If you'd like to let us know which hotel you're staying at, or a nearby intersection, we can give you some recommendations that are within a few blocks of it.  Finally, here are links to two more discussions that will give you an overview of what Chicago has to offer, in addition to the link already provided.

Train, cab, van, limo sedan?&#10;We arent renting a car...  You don't mention which airport, or exactly where near the Mag Mile you're staying, but the answer is going to be similar regardless.  The cheapest way is to take the el (that's our subway system, portions of which are elevated).  The fare is $2.25 per adult, $1.00 for kids 7-11.  You can transfer from one el line to another for free (at certain stations; see below) and you can pay $.25 extra to transfer to a bus, as long as you're using a fare card rather than paying cash each time.  The CTA Blue Line runs from O'Hare to the Loop, and the CTA Orange Line runs from Midway to the Loop.  Assuming from your original post that your hotel is near the Mag Mile, you may want to transfer to the CTA Red Line and take it to one of the stops near the Mag Mile (Grand/State or Chicago/State), or it may be easier to transfer to a bus that runs right up Michigan Avenue.  (The free transfer from the Blue Line is at Jackson; walk downstairs from the train platform for the tunnel to the Red Line.  You need to use a fare card or pass for the free transfer from the Orange Line, which is at Library or at State/Lake.)  The total travel time including a transfer will probably be around an hour from either airport.

Assuming your flight arrives at Midway at 2:20 pm, traffic probably won't be too bad, even if it's a little late and it takes you a little while to get your luggage.  The Stevenson (I-55) is not usually all that bad inbound in the late afternoon rush (unlike the Kennedy - I-90/94 - which gets bad in both directions in rush hour).  If you're taking the el from Midway, there's no need to transfer to the Red Line; just get off at State/Lake and it's about a three block walk to the Hyatt Regency.  The el is a bit of a walk at the airport end as well; you have to walk through the parking garage to the el station (it's clearly marked).  If your luggage is minimal and on wheels, it's easily doable; if you have a lot of luggage and need the convenience, a cab is an option.  Of the places mentioned above for deep-dish pizza, the original Uno and Due are the closest to your hotel, about a ten-minute walk. &#10;" /><attribute name="epoch_seconds" value="1301374800" /></branch><branch><attribute name="name" value="message not name" /><attribute name="type" value="message" /><attribute name="message_id" value="6428641" /><attribute name="author" value="Lyn7279" /><attribute name="message_date" value="2011-03-31 10:54:00" /><attribute name="message_body" value="&#10; Well for now I think we will do a taxi due to the fact with a child and baggage...

Our whole meal, we couldn't ask for more...except more of that food here and now..haha.  Of course we had some normal foods too and since we couldn't get away from museums we didn't get Beef or DOgs until the airport but they were ok. We have a place here called Chicago Dawgs and it is AWESOME and I think it does better service to the dogs and beef than what we had but hey whatever, we just ate there because hubby HAD to have a Beef sandwich before we left CHicago.

Hands down. No question. &#10;Not just the best restaurant in Chicago, but the best in the United States.  I agree, 100 percent. Based on posts here and elsewhere, most of those who have been to most of the high-end restaurants here would agree, too.  &gt;&gt; You can't get reservations for July 2012; they book about 3 months out.  I believe they start taking reservations on the first of the month, 2-3 months out. So at least as of right now, they would start taking reservations on May 1, 2012, for dates in July 2012.  A lot can happen in 15 months. Restaurants can close, and others can open. Restaurants can improve, and others can decline.  I would not even think about where to eat more than about four months in advance.  There isn't a single restaurant in Chicago where you have to make a reservation any further out than that.  Regarding what else is great in Chicago, a few days ago the question was asked, &quot;I already have a reservation at Alinea, but what's the next best high-end restaurant?&quot; in the discussion at " /><attribute name="epoch_seconds" value="1301806800" /></branch><branch><attribute name="name" value="message not name" /><attribute name="type" value="message" /><attribute name="message_id" value="6435797" /><attribute name="author" value="Chef Jimmy J" /><attribute name="message_date" value="2011-04-03 11:02:00" /><attribute name="message_body" value="&#10; Thank you both, I read your above mentioned post.

Yes, in my opinion.  What I find truly amazing about Alinea is that, as unusual as all of the preparation and presentation techniques are, the food turns out to be incredibly delicious.  I can't make the same statement about Moto.  Not that Moto is bad - it's decent and it's fun - but I wouldn't consider it one of my top meals of the year (whereas Alinea qualifies among my top meals ever). &#10;" /><attribute name="epoch_seconds" value="1301806800" /></branch><branch><attribute name="name" value="message not name" /><attribute name="type" value="message" /><attribute name="message_id" value="6436162" /><attribute name="author" value="chicgail" /><attribute name="message_date" value="2011-04-03 13:33:00" /><attribute name="message_body" value="&#10; I wouldn't bother with Moto.  What Moto and Alinea have in common are the techniques of molecular gastronomy.

Especially if you are planning on Alinea, I would choose another top end restaurant for your visit, rather than Moto. &#10;" /><attribute name="epoch_seconds" value="1301806800" /></branch><branch><attribute name="name" value="message not name" /><attribute name="type" value="message" /><attribute name="message_id" value="6439593" /><attribute name="author" value="Siun" /><attribute name="message_date" value="2011-04-04 18:39:00" /><attribute name="message_body" value="&#10; I'm a " /><attribute name="epoch_seconds" value="1301893200" /></branch><branch><attribute name="name" value="message not name" /><attribute name="type" value="message" /><attribute name="message_id" value="6439599" /><attribute name="author" value="Siun" /><attribute name="message_date" value="2011-04-04 18:41:00" /><attribute name="message_body" value="&#10; Forgot to mention - Next is about to open along with Aviary - so I'd look for opportunities to buy tickets for that as well.

Alinea: This is the best of the best.  Service, taste, creativity.  Everything is spot on, and then some.  Molecular gastronomy is not for everyone, but Alinea succeeds in not being gimmicky.  Everything is done behind the scene and for reasons of enhancing taste or smell of the dish.  It's popular and hard to get in with short notice.  But if you plan ahead (and it seems that you are), you should be fine landing a reservation.    2. Avenues: This is also very very good.  Best amuse bouche and beef dish I've ever had, anywhere.  More traditional than Alinea in some aspects (bread service, champaign cart...).  But the food is still quite creative and beautifully presented.  Of two different tasting menus I've had there, I've only had one dish that didn't work (dark chocolate ganache in pumpkin soup), but even then it wasn't bad and was quite interesting.    3. L2O:  I love L2O.  But I went when Gras was still there.   Best seafood, desserts, and bread service in the city.  Meat courses didn't shine, but weren't bad.  Service and decor were great.    4. Everest / Spiaggia: Chicago is the temple of contemporary American cuisine.  These two, however, represent the best of European cuisines in the city.  Everest is French, and Spiaggia is Italian.  Both have great food.    5. Schwa: I love the food at Schwa.  From a pure food point of view, I'd rank it lower only to Alinea.  But I don't think you want to risk the tricky reservation system or the possibility of having your reservation canceled last minute.  That's why I rank it this low. &#10;" /><attribute name="epoch_seconds" value="1301806800" /></branch><branch><attribute name="name" value="message not name" /><attribute name="type" value="message" /><attribute name="message_id" value="6440260" /><attribute name="author" value="Chef Jimmy J" /><attribute name="message_date" value="2011-04-05 05:26:00" /><attribute name="message_body" value="&#10; Thank you all for your responses.

I'm not particularly fond of the Publican. It's REALLY REALLY NOISY, for one thing. Also, your group of eight will be stuck at one of the loooooong communal tables (they also have private tables but only for parties up to six) and those at one end of your group won't be able to hear those at the other end. The food is pretty good (but NOT fantastic IMO), and the desserts are dreadful.  I haven't been to Girl and the Goat yet; I have a reservation later this month.  Joe's is good, but I think David Burke's Primehouse is even better, if you're looking for a steakhouse. However, we just had three major steakhouses open in the past couple of months, and there will undoubtedly be more opening in the next 15 months. Unless you know that your group loves steaks and nothing else, you can do far better by choosing a restaurant that will impress folks because they don't have it (or don't have the same quality) back home, and a steakhouse may not do that for you. See below for specific suggestions.  I ate at Weber Grill for lunch recently. It was pretty good. But it's a nationwide chain, and it's not anything your group can't get back home.  If you want food that will really impress your group, I would start with one of our creative provincial Mexican restaurants, with food that you can't find in most cities in the United States (although that could change in 15 months). Topolobampo and Frontera Grill in River North are still excellent (closed Sundays though), so is Salpicon in Old Town (open Sundays only for brunch), and Mexique in West Town (open for brunch and dinner Saturdays and Sundays, closed Mondays). I would also consider one of our best contemporary American restaurants (Sable in River North, North Pond in Lincoln Park), one of our contemporary Italian restaurants (Cibo Matto or the Florentine in the Loop), and something ethnic such as the tapas at Mercat a la Planxa. I would also consider one of the great restaurants that will be opening here later this year, that we don't know about yet. :) &#10;" /><attribute name="epoch_seconds" value="1302066000" /></branch><branch><attribute name="name" value="message not name" /><attribute name="type" value="message" /><attribute name="message_id" value="6445965" /><attribute name="author" value="Chef Jimmy J" /><attribute name="message_date" value="2011-04-06 22:25:00" /><attribute name="message_body" value="&#10; Ok, this will be the last beating of this, temporarily(12 months), dead horse for now.

I'll be at SPACE in Evanston on Friday night and I'll be at a show in Wicker Park on Saturday. I'm staying downtown at The Allerton and I have a car but will be using the public transportation to get around. I read the recent post on Evanston and I didn't see much there that really stood out. So my thoughts are should we catch some dinner on the way there or is there somewhere there that is really worth it. Here are my thoughts so far: &#10;Thursday: Kuma's or Depot Diner on the drive in, " /><attribute name="epoch_seconds" value="1299564000" /><branch><attribute name="name" value="message not name" /><attribute name="type" value="message" /><attribute name="message_id" value="6365906" /><attribute name="author" value="nsxtasy" /><attribute name="message_date" value="2011-03-08 14:33:00" /><attribute name="message_body" value="&#10; I'll address the Evanston part first.  There are some outstanding restaurants in Evanston, and they vary in cuisine and price.  If you don't see much, you're just not looking very hard!  Let's start with SPACE and the area around it.  SPACE is behind Union Pizzeria, just south of Dempster.  They let you order a pizza at Union and bring it in to SPACE, but I do not recommend doing so.  The seating at SPACE is such that you will either be 4-6 seats crowded around a tiny cocktail table, or you will be in a row of seats with nowhere to put the pizza.  You can eat at SPACE before the show, but honestly I didn't care much for the pizza there.  There are a few other restaurants in the immediate vicinity, but nothing I would recommend, with the exception of Blind Faith for vegetarian cuisine.  There are two much larger concentrations of restaurants not too far away, around Main Street a half mile south of SPACE, and all of downtown Evanston a half mile north of SPACE.  Note that, for public transportation, the el stops at Main, Dempster (near SPACE), and Davis (near downtown Evanston), while Metra commuter trains stop at Main and Davis but not Dempster.  So, for example, you could take the CTA or Metra to Main Street, eat at one of the restaurants there for dinner, and then walk the half mile north to SPACE, and take the el back from Dempster.  Around Main and Chicago, you have several excellent choices.  Oceanique is an upscale restaurant with a focus on seafood and I think it's the best restaurant in all of Evanston.  Cross Rhodes is a very casual inexpensive restaurant serving gyros and other Greek dishes.  Campagnola is an excellent moderately-priced Italian restaurant.  Lupita's is the best Mexican restaurant in Evanston (if you go, concentrate on the weekly specials).  And Lucky Platter is a casual place serving eclectic American and global cuisine.  Oceanique, Campagnola, and Cross Rhodes may very well be the best expensive, mid-priced, and inexpensive restaurants in all of Evanston.  In downtown Evanston, there are many, many choices.  You mention Pete Miller's, which is an excellent steakhouse.  Chef's Station serves excellent contemporary American cuisine.  The Stained Glass is a wine bar that also has excellent contemporary American cuisine.  Thai Sookdee is my favorite Thai restaurant in the Chicago area (their tom kha gai soup is awesome).  If you enjoy deep-dish pizza, there's Lou Malnati's for single-crust &quot;pizza in the pan&quot; and Giordano's for double-crust &quot;stuffed pizza&quot;.  I consider this group the best places in downtown Evanston.    There are lots more choices in downtown Evanston.  Bistro Bordeaux is a French bistro; I had a couple of excellent dinners when they opened a year ago, but I recently ate there and it was just okay.  Other restaurants downtown include Lulu's Dim Sum (pan-Asian), Koi (Chinese), Pine Yard (Chinese), Merle's (barbecue), Davis Street Fishmarket (seafood), Bat 17 (sandwiches/deli), Dixie Kitchen (cajun/creole), Mt. Everest (Indian), Tapas Barcelona (tapas), and That Little Mexican Cafe (Mexican).  One more option is Prairie Moon, which is located at the south end of downtown Evanston so it's a bit closer to SPACE than the other downtown places mentioned here.  Prairie Moon has American food and it's sort of sports bar-ish, but the food is very good.  If I were eating at SPACE and wanted to eat at a place that's reasonably close and has great food, my top picks would be Oceanique, Campagnola, Prairie Moon, or Cross Rhodes, depending on what kind of food you want and how much you want to spend. &#10;" /><attribute name="epoch_seconds" value="1299564000" /></branch><branch><attribute name="name" value="message not name" /><attribute name="type" value="message" /><attribute name="message_id" value="6365966" /><attribute name="author" value="nsxtasy" /><attribute name="message_date" value="2011-03-08 14:52:00" /><attribute name="message_body" value="&#10; Now, moving on to the rest of your plans...  &gt;&gt; Thursday: Kuma's or Depot Diner on the drive in, Nacional 27, CDA, or Cafe Spiaggia, Watershed for drinks  All three of those dinner options are good choices; it's just a matter of what kind of food you are interested in (Latin fusion, contemporary American/French, or Italian).  &gt;&gt; Friday: Fronterra Lunch, then on the way to Evanston maybe hit Tango Sur or Sapore Di Napoli (we love BYOB) or maybe somewhere in Evanston Pete Millers?  I assume either you have a reservation at Frontera Grill, or are aware that you may need to wait a LONG time to be seated.  If you don't already have a reservation at Frontera, I recommend instead making one on Opentable.com for Topolobampo, its sister restaurant next door (it's actually just another dining room inside Frontera).  Topolobampo is a lot more expensive at dinnertime, but lunch prices are very similar to Frontera's, and it's easy to get a reservation at Topolobampo.  For dinner, there are so many excellent places in Evanston, I recommend choosing one and eating there.  That will work a lot better than eating elsewhere, which would require you to eat earlier to allow time to travel to Evanston after dinner.  &gt;&gt; Saturday: Breakfast maybe Orange or HoS then a late lunch and snacking at the French Market, Dinner @ Big Star in Wicker Park.   Note that Heaven on Seven serves breakfast only at its Loop (Wabash) location, not the location on Rush Street in River North.

I had a friend recommend Orange and I've read up on HoS but it seems pretty standard. I think the Bongo Room would be great but it's a ways away right?  Right.  Bongo Room has two locations, one in the South Loop that's about two miles south of the Allerton (a short trip by cab, bus, or el), and the other in Wicker Park that's about 2.8 miles northwest of the Allerton.  And you're right, Orange is pretty good, but won't blow you away.  One nice thing, they have fresh fruit juices (you can select your own blend).    The best breakfast near the Allerton is probably Cafe des Architectes, in the Sofitel, just a few blocks away.  They serve a nice a la carte brunch on Saturdays and Sundays; I love the variety you get on their &quot;brunch sampler&quot; and they bring that basket of French breads/pastries to the table, yum!  I haven't been there for a weekday breakfast but I'm sure that's good too.  Another good choice for breakfast, a few blocks further north, is the Original Pancake House on East Bellevue.  &gt;&gt; Also any great casual bars or happy hours in the areas we will be in would be great.  I love Sable, which is also only a few blocks from the Allerton, in the Palomar.  It's casual and they have great artisanal cocktails.  I also love the food; it's worth considering for a dinner, even during a brief stay.  Many of their dishes are available in half portions if you're just grazing while drinking.  Don't miss the sweet corn creme brulee! &#10;" /><attribute name="epoch_seconds" value="1299823200" /></branch><branch><attribute name="name" value="message not name" /><attribute name="type" value="message" /><attribute name="message_id" value="6374349" /><attribute name="author" value="chicgail" /><attribute name="message_date" value="2011-03-11 10:27:00" /><attribute name="message_body" value="&#10; Big Star is excellent, but it's largely a bar -- good beers and margaritas -- with innovative, interesting, and tasty tacos.

I could name a lot more of them, but if that's all you're looking for, you may as well go somewhere close to your hotel (like Orange or Tempo, which is a diner type place).  And the big problem (to which chicgail alluded) is that none of them take reservations, so that long waits to be seated are prevalent on Saturdays and Sundays, unless you go early (typically before about 9:30 you won't have problems).  A few of the breakfast places offer food that's more unusual and creative than just plain old omelets and pancakes.  These include Bongo Room as well as Jam (in West Town), M. Henry (in Andersonville), M. Henrietta (in Edgewater), Southport Grocery (in Lakeview), and Toast (in Bucktown and Lincoln Park), which chicgail mentioned and which does a nice stuffed French toast.

I thought maybe Chinatown or some Thai? Is it worth the trip to Chinatown or can I get something just as good closer? I looked at Reza's? Maybe some great Italian lunch or any crazy/unique suggestions?  What your itinerary now lacks is any of our creative provincial Mexican cuisine.  This is one of the strengths of Chicago and it's impossible to find in most cities this side of the border with Mexico.  (Take a look at the menus on the restaurant websites to understand how this differs from the conventional Mexican cuisine found in most of the United States.)  Furthermore, many of those Mexican restaurants are open for brunch/lunch on Saturdays, which makes them a perfect choice.  This would be my top recommendation BY FAR for brunch/lunch on Saturday.  Earlier you had mentioned Frontera Grill; however, unless you have a reservation (unlikely), you'll need to wait 90+ minutes for their Saturday brunch, which to me is not acceptable.  Last time I wanted a Mexican brunch, I went instead to Mundial Cocina Mestiza, and it was fantastic.  Mundial is in the Pilsen neighborhood about three miles southwest of the Loop.  Mixteco Grill is another excellent choice, and it's on the north side, which makes it particularly convenient to Evanston, and somewhat so to Wicker Park.  If you're staying in Wicker Park (or in the downtown hotel district), Mexique is very close and it's another great choice.  All these are open for brunch on Saturdays and I recommend any of them as a great example of some of Chicago's best, most unique food.  Mexique accepts reservations on Opentable as well as over the phone; Mundial and Mixteco accept reservations over the phone only.  I would not choose Chinese or Thai or Italian over Mexican.  However, if you insist...  In my recent experience, the Chinese restaurants in Chinatown are much, MUCH better than any place I've been elsewhere in the Chicago area.  As for Thai food, my favorite Thai restaurant in the Chicago area is Thai Sookdee in Evanston (their tom kha gai soup is outstanding).  For Italian, I know Cafe Spiaggia is open for lunch on Saturdays and would be a good choice.  I hate to be repetitive, but I think you're missing out on something special if you don't have our Mexican cuisine while you're here. &#10;" /><attribute name="epoch_seconds" value="1302152400" /></branch><branch><attribute name="name" value="message not name" /><attribute name="type" value="message" /><attribute name="message_id" value="6447104" /><attribute name="author" value="Smavo" /><attribute name="message_date" value="2011-04-07 10:35:00" /><attribute name="message_body" value="&#10; So since I was thinking Big Star for Dinner on Saturday, maybe I'll do " /><attribute name="epoch_seconds" value="1302152400" /></branch><branch><attribute name="name" value="message not name" /><attribute name="type" value="message" /><attribute name="message_id" value="6447209" /><attribute name="author" value="nsxtasy" /><attribute name="message_date" value="2011-04-07 11:09:00" /><attribute name="message_body" value="&#10; Sorry, I missed the reference to Big Star.

The view, if one is in to that, is certainly better at Everest.  I was at Trotter's in July and it just seemed to be resting on its laurels.  While I have had service issues at Everest, I have to believe that is not the norm.  And the service at Trotter's in July was certainly not what it once was.

It's a last-minute trip (anniversary is April 10), so reservations are a bit tricky. We'd like a restaurant with soul-satisfying food that will be memorable, even if it's a hole-in-the-wall. Price isn't as important as quality. And above all else, we'd like a place that is intimate and isn't too boisterous.  I think a great choice for your romantic dinner is Everest. It's one of the finest restaurants in the city (expensive, and formal - jackets required for gentlemen). The food is outstanding French-Alsatian cuisine, and they have an incredible wine list, with the best selection of Alsatian wines of any restaurant in the country. The view from the 40th floor of the Midwest Stock Exchange Building looking out over the city is thrilling (ask for a window table). The service is the very best I have ever experienced anywhere (even though another poster here had a less satisfactory service experience there but reported wonderful food). And, also important, you can probably still get a reservation for the day/time you want this coming weekend.

Beware, Avec has a LOT of downsides that you need to know before deciding to go there.  They don't take reservations and waits to be seated are often 60-90 minutes or more on weekends and opera nights, unless you go really early or really late.  They ONLY have communal seating so you'll be sitting at a table alongside strangers, or at the bar alongside strangers.

It's in the West Town neighborhood, two miles west of the Mag Mile hotel area; you can get their via cab or the #66 CTA bus. Prices are moderate, with entrees around twenty.

Sorry, but I've been to Uno twice with out-of-towners who insisted we go there ... both times on a Saturday night, both times we were REQUIRED to place our order at the same time we put our names down for a table, both times had to wait more than two hours for a table, and when the pizza was brought (both times, before our drinks were served), it was clear that the pizza had been waiting under the hotlamps for at least an hour.

The pizza was fantastic!&#10;Well, I left Chicago in 1968 to go to school in Boulder and then stayed here (what a surprise.) However, whenever I visited the city Uno's pizza was a must have.  Unfortunately, I have seen a serious degradation in quality over the past decade. My last two pizzas over the last two years will be my last.  The sauce was watery and tasteless.  The crust was soggy and the whole thing was underdone.   All in all, a really poor excuse for pizza.

I honestly have never understood all oohs and aahs over Lou's, as far as deep dish goes; it's good, but not &quot;great&quot;. From the original in Lincolnwood to all the satellites (Downtown, Buffalo Grove &amp; Gurnee)they were all equally mediocore. One positive note here, other than Nancy's &amp; Giordano's, Lou's is the only other local chain that has maintained consistent product from store to store, so pretty much no matter where you dine your experience will be about equal.   The same certainly cannot be said for Gino's East (especially Libertyville) &amp; Unos &quot;Chicago Grill&quot;.

I would suggest that once you narrow down your choices, you might want to re-post and ask for opinions on the particular locations you are considering, to get a more specific assessment of the actual place you would be eating at. &#10;" /><attribute name="epoch_seconds" value="1156309200" /></branch><branch><attribute name="name" value="message not name" /><attribute name="type" value="message" /><attribute name="message_id" value="1828024" /><attribute name="author" value="phelana" /><attribute name="message_date" value="2006-08-23 18:14:00" /><attribute name="message_body" value="&#10; we are keen in Bacios on Wacker bc we can walk there...ok?? &#10;" /><attribute name="epoch_seconds" value="1156309200" /></branch><branch><attribute name="name" value="message not name" /><attribute name="type" value="message" /><attribute name="message_id" value="2048838" /><attribute name="author" value="csurugbyhooker" /><attribute name="message_date" value="2006-11-27 04:16:00" /><attribute name="message_body" value="&#10; I prefer Gino's East when in Chicago (the whole sausage patty on the bottom of the deep dish is amazing), but I can't stand the lines and the touristy atmosphere at the Superior location.

Deep dish pizza has a crust with higher walls. Stuffed pizza is deep-dish with a second crust on top (like a double crust apple pie). Bacino's, Nancy's and Giordano's all specialize in stuffed pizza. A pan pizza is a thicker crust made in pan, but the crust is of uniform thickness with no walls. Therefore, the cheese comes in contact with the sides of the pan resulting in a carmelized edge.  The pan pizza crust is crunchy on the bottom but soft and moist like bread on the top, so it blends with the cheese.  Examples of pan-pizza are Gulliver's, Pequod's and Burt's. &#10;" /><attribute name="epoch_seconds" value="1164693600" /></branch><branch><attribute name="name" value="message not name" /><attribute name="type" value="message" /><attribute name="message_id" value="2052289" /><attribute name="author" value="abf005" /><attribute name="message_date" value="2006-11-28 14:28:00" /><attribute name="message_body" value="&#10; Nice synopsis on the different variations of pan vs. deep.

After I wrote that, I thought about Gulliver's and realized their pizza is what I would consider a sort of cross between pan and deep-dish (they call it pan). It has changed somewhat over the years, but it definitely has the &quot;breadiness&quot; of pan pizza. However, I still contend that true pan pizza should be of uniform thickness across the entire crust. For the classic &quot;pizza in the pan&quot;, one has to go to Burt's Place in Morton Grove. Burt was the original owner of Pequod's, as well as a founding partner in Gulliver's. Prior to that, he owned Dante's Inferno in Evanston going back to the early 1960s. He is the originator of that style of pizza (or close to it), and when it comes to pan pizza, he is the true master.  Burt's Place&#10;8541 N.

 &quot;Lou's father founded Pizzeria Uno and Due&quot;  Minor correction: &#8220;possibly&#8221; co-founded.    Fact: Ike Sewell invented and founded and OWNED Uno &amp; Due pizza starting back in 1943.  I have seen two versions this widely held myth. One is the Pizano&#8217;s web version which outright claims Rudy Malnati Sr. founded Unos by himself. The second is the Lou Manati web/menu version, which claims that both Rudy &amp; his son Lou worked at the original Unos.  Either way, the bottom line is that the Malnati family claims that Rudy &amp; Lou both had an affiliation with Uno's starting as far back as the early 40's. But if you go straight to the sources at Uno's, there is no mention of any of the Malnati's or of what their involvement level was.   My guess is that both Rudy and Lou did indeed work for Ike Sewell as openly stated and that probably after many dutiful years of dough tossing for Ike they separated from Uno's around 1970. Then in 1971 after they had saved up enough dough of their own, they founded their own wildly famous Lou Malnati&#8217;s pizzeria using the Uno name and fame as their resume with which to compete.  This must have really ticked off the Unos folks since they became modern ledgends!

My favorite place was Ray's on 127th.  But, sadly, after changing hands a couple of times, it's no longer there.  (There was also a great place for cheap pies called Gold Rush, where you could get a decent sized pizza for under $5 - granted that was over 15 years ago).    The local chain Beggars Pizza, for me, is the next best thing, however.  They have locations in Blue Island, Merrionette Park, Oak Forest (or is that Midlothian?) and some other places.  Per their tag line, they do &quot;lay it on thick&quot; ... nice crust, great cheese and ingredients.  Another local chain, Aurelio's is damn good as well.  I'm now in Grayslake and find Bill's (locations in Washington Park and Mundelein), Pat's (Grayslake) and another local chain, Lou Malnati's to be the best (though the location in Washington Park hasn't been as good of late for some reason).  But if I'm in the mood to drive a bit out of my comfort zone, I like Pizza Italia (Libertyville, Mundelein &amp; Vernon Hills).  Good crisp crust, nice sweet sauce and fresh ingredients.

I frequently eat pizza at Giordano's and at Lou Malnati's.  Both are excellent at what they do, but the style is entirely different.  With Giordano's stuffed pizza, in the center section of the pizza, the crust blends well in a perfect balance with the cheese, sauce, and any added ingredients (&quot;toppings&quot; is a bit of a misnomer), with tremendous flavor.  Along the edges, the crust is delicious, like the tastiest bread or cracker you've ever had.  Whereas with Malnati's pan pizza, the single center crust is thicker than Giordano's, which gives it a more discernible flavor, although there too there's a nice balance among the crust, cheese, sauce, and added ingredients, but each stands out a bit more than the blended flavor of Giordano's.  Both are delicious and excellent, each in its own way; I still prefer Giordano's, but I like Malnati's too, for an occasional change of pace. &#10;" /><attribute name="epoch_seconds" value="1203141600" /></branch><branch><attribute name="name" value="message not name" /><attribute name="type" value="message" /><attribute name="message_id" value="3696821" /><attribute name="author" value="peteypizza" /><attribute name="message_date" value="2008-05-17 14:06:00" /><attribute name="message_body" value="&#10; The Chicago Pizza Club has recently put together a top 5 list.

 My friend (no romantic dinners) and I will be spending 3 days in Chicago in early may.  We will be staying in the really nice James Hotel, corner Ontario and Rush.  These are four places that I've read about on Chowhound:
Quartino
Mercat a la Planxa
Caf&#233; Iberico
Knowit  What we really LIKE is good food, young upcomming chefs, local products, classic european style quality bistro, and what we really LOVE is wine, wine and wine...  We don't mind walking a few blocks or even taking a cab ride if necessary for a good glass of wine and the great food that comes with it.  We have a medium budget but don,t mind paying for a great meal if it is worth the cash.  We are both from Qu&#233;bec City, which is north of Montreal, so we are used to live in a french/european style city where the food reflects the town.  Not so much into dogs, Lavazza, chains, pizza, anything fried...  Thanks for all your help

Knowit  What is &quot;Knowit&quot;? I'm pretty sure it's not a restaurant in Chicago.  The other three restaurants are all very good. However, they are all quite similar to each other; all three feature Mediterranean cuisine in &quot;small plates&quot; (tapas). If that's what you REALLY want to do, go ahead! However, I think you could experience more of what Chicago's restaurant scene has to offer by trying to incorporate a bit more variety into your itinerary. (And for the same reason I would not recommend adding Avec to your itinerary, since that would be your FOURTH Mediterranean small-plates restaurant, LOL!)   Here are a few examples of terrific, not-terribly-expensive restaurants near your hotel that do NOT feature Mediterranean small plates. You might want to consider going to Cafe des Architectes ( " /><attribute name="epoch_seconds" value="1240290000" /></branch><branch><attribute name="name" value="message not name" /><attribute name="type" value="message" /><attribute name="message_id" value="4617871" /><attribute name="author" value="Pete Oldtown" /><attribute name="message_date" value="2009-04-22 08:10:00" /><attribute name="message_body" value="&#10; Thank you for the American Dim Sum suggestion.

Here are some insider tips about the American dim sum Sunday brunch at David Burke's, just a few things to keep in mind.  The brunch does a pretty good business; there have been times when I've checked for reservations and they were not available, or were only available earlier or later than I wanted.  So making an advance reservation (which they accept on Opentable.com) is a good idea, especially if you need a specific time.  Allow at least two hours for the brunch.  That's how long it took me as a solo diner (which generally means a slightly faster pace than a group) without getting any seconds on anything.  I arrived at 1:00 and finished at 3:00.  They were definitely winding down at that point, so I would avoid being seated any later than that.  The portion sizes are somewhat small, as you would expect with ~22 items.  I arrived hungry and left feeling full (not overstuffed/bloated, but definitely full) after eating each of the plated items, and some but not all of the items on the carts used for 2 of the 8 courses.  The price and menu is different on special occasions.  For example, the brunch is normally $35 for adults, but it's $48 with a different menu for Easter and Mother's Day.  The menu says that serving is family style, which is not necessarily the same as the dim sum approach.  Several of the drinks - bloody marys, mimosas, etc - are offered at $10 with unlimited seconds.  This is a great deal; just don't overdo it, and consider transportation arrangements or a designated driver if appropriate.  It's really a very special and unique experience - enjoy! &#10;" /><attribute name="epoch_seconds" value="1240376400" /></branch><branch><attribute name="name" value="message not name" /><attribute name="type" value="message" /><attribute name="message_id" value="4618864" /><attribute name="author" value="Pete Oldtown" /><attribute name="message_date" value="2009-04-22 12:41:00" /><attribute name="message_body" value="&#10; Thanks for the tips.

Back to the Tasting Room, the upstairs room has a wonderful view of the entire skyline and the wines are always great.  Food is also very nice, but not a destination in itself for dinner.

I know you don't like pizza but I would be remiss if i did not mention that the original Due's is on the same block and the original Uno's is a block away.

Be sure to check their hours first (not open til 10:00 on Saturdays and closed Sundays).

I know it's corny, but I'd like to get a good dog and/or Italian beef joint...thoughts? Doug's or Portillo's seem to fit the dog bill, how about the italian beef? I'm not interested in driving across town for either of these, FWIW.  I'd pick Topo for lunch over Frontera.  The prices are similar (which means that Topo represents more of a discount vs dinner) and you can make a reservation, so there are no concerns over waiting for a table.  I would make the res soon rather than risk being a walk-in (when Topo can get busy with the overflow from Frontera).  Since you're not keen on traveling, I'd skip Hot Doug's and go to either Al's Beef or Portillo's.  Both are a block apart in River North, and either one has an excellent representation of both Chicago hot dogs and Italian beef sandwiches.  &gt;&gt; Dinner - Pizza for sure one night (Uno, Due or Malnati's), Frontera or Topolo might be the other (I have a slight Rick Bayless/mexican food fascination).  A lunch AND a dinner?  Interesting!  You can certainly do that if you want (assuming you can get the Topo reservation or you don't mind a possible wait at Frontera - to be sure of no waiting, arrive 15 minutes before they open).  If you're interested in trying another creative regional Mexican restaurant, Salpicon is very good and is not far from the Bayless places.

LB Bistro, Yolk and Southwater have been recommended...any that I should put above the rest?  If you want something different from what you'll find just about anywhere else, consider Bongo Room.  Particularly good if you enjoy sweet dishes like their pretzel pancakes with white chocolate sauce; if you're just looking for eggs or other savory items, not all that unusual.  Another unusual possibility is XOCO, Rick Bayless's place.  It's very different from Topolobampo.  Check out the menu on their website.  &gt;&gt; Friday Lunch - ? Maybe Doug's on the way out of town.

Second, I absolutely loved the visit.  Hotel Sax is in a GREAT location.  Walking distance from everything I wanted to go to.  The room was nice, the staff was wonderful...I would definitely return.  Now, on to business.  Day 1 - I didn't get on the road as early as I wanted to (surprise, surprise) so I ended up hitting some good traffic for the last 10 miles or so of my trip.  Minor distraction.  Got checked in around 5:30, basically threw my bags in the room and went right back out.  Spent the next 45-60 minutes just walking around.  I can use google maps only so much.  I wanted to see the lay of the land.  I passed by Rick Bayless' restaurant row and a smile crossed my face.  I couldn't help myself.  I had to make...  1) Xoco my first stop.   A moderate line (~10 people) awaited, as did another 5 or so minute wait for a table after I got to the front.  I've never had a torta before, so I figured this would be a good chance to start.  I was deciding between the Cubana and the daily special, which was Pork Belly.  I went with the special and was seated in the back of the restaurant.  The wall of sound kept me entertained, as did the death rattle of a young child apparently unhappy with his experience.   My torta arrived and the first thing I noticed was the overwhelming amount of bread compared to the filling.  Probably 3/4 bread, which was discouraging.  My first bite revealed a nice crusty bread and little else.  As I continued to work, I got the flavor of bacon, arugula and the glaze, but the pork belly flavor was mild at best.  The sandwich continued this way and left me discouraged.  Walking back on to the street brought new life.  I love the vibe in river north.  It helped that the weather was absolutely perfect (65-70 and sunny) for my entire stay.  I walked a few blocks up Clark to the corner of Ontario.  There stood my second stop.  2) Portillos - I'm a complete junkie for hot dogs, so this was an easy choice.  I must admit, I wasn't expecting the mall food court experience I walked into.  Minor gripe.  One Chicago dog + one chili cheese dog and I was on my way.  First, the Chicago dog.  I had to start with the classic.  The first big was mostly dog and bun...heavenly.  The bun puts it over the top.  I have to admit, though, that the rest of the Chicago dog toppings get a little muddled for me.  Oh well, I finished it and moved on.  The chili cheese dog was outrageous.  I have no idea if this chili is homemade, where the cheese comes from, etc.  And I don't really care.  This was as good as any dog I've ever had (though this sentiment would change).  I walked out of Portillos with a huge smile on my face, but still a rumble in my tummy (nearly 8 hours of non-stop driving had left my famished).  So, down the road I went to...  3) " /><attribute name="epoch_seconds" value="1272344400" /></branch><branch><attribute name="name" value="message not name" /><attribute name="type" value="message" /><attribute name="message_id" value="5523684" /><attribute name="author" value="lbs" /><attribute name="message_date" value="2010-04-05 07:47:00" /><attribute name="message_body" value="&#10; Publican wasn't that loud in my opinion.

(I have heard that the restaurant is aware of the problem and is looking into solutions.)  The reason it's so loud is that it has a lot of hard surfaces (mostly wooden seats, tables, and decor) and high ceilings and virtually no soft surfaces to deaden the sound.  I was there on a weekday with a somewhat early reservation; they were still not quite full when we left and the place was already at a FULL ROAR.  As for those terrible desserts, they really need to hire a pastry chef if they want to consider themselves a destination restaurant.  I thought the waffle dessert was dreadful, just a plain overbland waffle; I've had better at Bob Evans.  The other two desserts (we tried all three on the menu) were no better; one was a chocolate sorbet that allegedly had some sea salt and caramel flavorings but were undetectable, and the third was a dried out, tasteless lemon poppyseed cake.  I'm glad I tried Publican, as I really liked some of their dishes (notably the sweetbreads), but I would never go back again.

However, we both found that while the food was perfectly acceptable, nothing special at all.  The only exception for us was the hamachi appetizer, which was, indeed, wonderful.  Worse, the service was both unctuous and omnipresent.  The waiter, rather than tell us anything about the menu items, basically read to us the menu descriptions, adding absolutely nothing.  For some reason he was pushing the deconstructed Caeser salad (&quot;It has white anchovies,&quot; he told us.  Twice).  Then our waiter, the bus boy, the manager, the chef and a couple of other people stopped by our table just about every 5 minutes throughout our meal to interrupt our conversation and ask us how everything was. We actually left finally laughing about it.    We won't bother to go back there, but can see how it could be a reasonably priced nice dinner for folks looking to be careful with what they spend.

The places with the biggest buzz are the Girl and the Goat and the Purple Pig.  G&amp;TG is Stephanie Izard's new place for contemporary American cuisine, and reservations open up three months in advance and fill up quickly thereafter.  You may or may not get seated quickly if you go without one (going at non prime times helps).  The Purple Pig specializes in pork, cheese, and charcuterie (just like the Publican).  It does not accept reservations and waits at dinnertime are lengthy.  I recommend going at lunchtime, since they serve the same menu all day anyway.  Sable is relatively new also, and I just love it.  It too has contemporary American cuisine, from Chef Heather Terhune.  Most of the dishes come in half portions as well as full ones, so you can try a lot of things.  Don't miss the sweet corn creme brulee!  For $20-25 of food you can stuff yourself, but don't let the price throw you, it's a classy place.  They also have artisanal cocktails.  And they take reservations on Opentable and they're not that hard to get.  Highly recommended!  &gt;&gt; at least one high end place (not quite Alinea, but in the ~$50 range)  $50 range is not high end.  Not even close.  Our truly high-end restaurants (Alinea, Everest, TRU, Spiaggia, Trotter's, etc) generally run in the $175-250 range per person including moderately-priced wine, tax, and tip.  The less formal &quot;finer dining&quot; restaurants (North Pond, MK, etc) typically run roughly half that amount (figure $75-110/pp).  I mentioned Sable and the Girl and the Goat above, and both are a bit less than that range (particularly Sable, which is quite the bargain); their food could qualify because they have the creative chefs normally found in high-end places, even though both are casual in style.  I'll add some notes at the end about places away from downtown, on your route.  &gt;&gt; at least one new ethnic place.  How about some Latin fusion (Carnivale, Nacional 27) or pan-Asian (Red Light, Sunda)?  &gt;&gt; P.S. If there is anything good on the outskirts of town (or beyond), I'm all ears. I'll be coming southbound on 94, so anything from Milwaukee down is fair game.  Two of my favorite restaurants are in the suburbs off the Edens, right along your route, and a third is on the north side not far from Wrigley.  I've eaten at all three of them several times in the past year or so, and frankly I think they're as good as anything downtown short of the super-expensive places.  Any would be suitable for your &quot;inexpensive high-end&quot; meal.  Here are links to the restaurant websites as well as my detailed reports:  1.

Once you get north of Lincoln Park, street parking becomes easier to find.  So if this is a major issue for you (and it sounds like it is), you may want to limit your search to neighborhoods north of Lincoln Park.  I don't know if you're specifically interested in tapas or other ethnic cuisine, or if more mainstream cuisines would work for you...?  Some of the good restaurants in neighborhoods north of Lincoln Park include contemporary American (Deleece in Lakeview, Sola in North Center, Magnolia Cafe in Uptown, Bluette in Wilmette, and Evanston's places - Chef's Station, Oceanique, the Stained Glass); French bistros (Bistro Campagne and LM in Lincoln Square; Bistro Bordeaux in Evanston); creative Mexican (Mixteco Grill in Lakeview, Mexique in West Town - okay, West Town is not north of LP but parking isn't too bad around there), Italian (Campagnola in Evanston); etc.  I've found street parking pretty easily around all of these except the three places in downtown Evanston, where there are inexpensive parking garages.  If you're specifically looking for the lively atmosphere you get at Cafe Ba-ba-reeba, my first choice among these would be Mixteco Grill... &#10;" /><attribute name="epoch_seconds" value="1301634000" /></branch><branch><attribute name="name" value="message not name" /><attribute name="type" value="message" /><attribute name="message_id" value="6433300" /><attribute name="author" value="belmont3" /><attribute name="message_date" value="2011-04-02 03:13:00" /><attribute name="message_body" value="&#10; Thank you so much for the info, I guess I should have specified that since so many people are driving separately 11 dollars for parking adds up to about 100 bucks!

However, up till now, I haven't seen a comprehensive topic on Mexican restaurants; as a result, it seems like a few of us are posting the same things over and over again.  Therefore, I'm creating this topic in the hopes that others will reply with their input and it will become a comprehensive discussion for anyone looking for recommendations for Mexican food in the Chicago area.  In addition to places I've already visited I'm including information about some places I haven't been to (yet!) in order to make the listings below as complete as possible.  Public transit directions and information on reservations are also included where available.  I hope others will add their own opinions and recommendations to this topic (even if they don't agree with mine!), on these restaurants as well as any others I may have missed.  I should also add that it's been fun looking through previous topics about Mexican restaurants, digging up new recommendations.  After looking at those topics, and the menus on the corresponding restaurant websites where available, there are now a whole lot more places I'm looking forward to trying!  For purposes of simplicity, I'm excluding places specializing in tacos and/or tortas (sandwiches).  We could create an entire, separate topic on those!  A NOTE ON CREATIVE/PROVINCIAL MEXICAN CUISINE&#10;---------------------------------------------  When we Chicagoans mention Mexican food to a lot of out-of-town visitors, their immediate reaction is &quot;but I can get that at home&quot;.  This is not necessarily true.  Chicago has a lot of very creative Mexican cuisine, including regional/provincial Mexican foods, and many of these foods are not all that common in most American cities.  We are not talking about conventional, common Mexican foods like enchiladas and carne asada (although we have plenty of those as well, the best of which are listed at the end of this post - and this is admittedly an arbitrary distinction).  We are talking about places that have several different kinds of mole, that serve a lot of different kinds of seafood and sauces, and other items that you just don't find anywhere.  For examples of some of the more unusual preparations, take a look at menus of the restaurants in the links to their websites below.  CREATIVE MEXICAN RESTAURANTS IN AND NEAR &quot;DOWNTOWN CHICAGO&quot;&#10;-----------------------------------------------------------  Several restaurants offer some of our most creative Mexican food, within an easy walk or a short cab/bus ride of the downtown areas where most of the large hotels are located.

 NS: Impressive write up!   I wont critique the places you&#8217;ve listed although I&#8217;ve been to several, but would rather suggest that the thread should also include the places that specialize in Taco/Burritos/Tortas (aka Taqueria&#8217;s) etc. as they are as relevant to a thread so broadly named as this one, especially if they are standouts. By this inclusion I think your idea will become quite the comprehensive thread on Chicago&#8217;s Mexican food scene!  It is also helpful and important to recognize the distinction of the numerous regional representations that are unique to Chicago&#8217;s Mexican restaurants.  Which has more impact if its called out, such as; Durango, Sonora, Nuevo Le&#243;n, Xalisco, Yucat&#225;n, Zacatecas etc. as well as Texas (Tex-Mex), and even New Mexico.  All of which have many representations in restaurants around town, I believe that along with the numerous innovative chefs which get so much attention, that one of the other things that makes Chicago such an amazing city in which to experience Mexican cuisine is its sheer variety and diversity from which these chefs draw their inspiration.  This thread covers a growing list of the Lake County Taqueria Mexican restaurants in the far northern suburbs of Lake County, IL: " /><attribute name="epoch_seconds" value="1196056800" /></branch><branch><attribute name="name" value="message not name" /><attribute name="type" value="message" /><attribute name="message_id" value="3480079" /><attribute name="author" value="paoconnell" /><attribute name="message_date" value="2008-03-10 19:53:00" /><attribute name="message_body" value="&#10; You got my attention, abf005.

I lived in Albuqueque for a two years. There was a New Mexican restaurant opened in Roscoe Village called Taos, but from what I heard, it's horrendous. You will be VERY hard pressed to find New Mexican food here. Also, there are regional differences that you need to be aware of:  Carne adovada  = probably more likely to be called a guisado de res (beef stew,) or guisado de puerco (pork stew)here.  Stacked Enchiladas - do not exist here. Rolled enchiladas are commonplace, however.  Red / Green Chile - Sorry. Just doesn't happen here. You'll get over the cravings eventually. and then, someone out of the blue will bring it up again (like you did) - and the cravings will start again. Nobody uses the hatch chilies either, so you're not really gonna find true red/green chile like you really want.  Posole - Most places here have this on wknds only. You'll do well for Posole, although I do not know what New Mexican style posole is.  NOW FOR THE GOOD PART:&#10;The mexican food options in Chicago are vastly superior to most in Albuquerque. If you go to the right places, and don't go to compare your favorite NM place to it, you will be MUCH happier, and find some GREAT mexican (not NEW Mexican) food.

Very little cumin is used in New Mexico food, except for chile con carne ('cause that's the Texas style, and that also means no beans either).   I've been able to find really good flour tortillas (La Banderita) in the Minneapolis area. I'm sure they're available in Chicago also, as the factory is near there. The problem with Minneapolis Mexican restaurants is that they're pretty bland compared to real NewMex and TexMex, so I'm looking for something better in the Chicago area.

I was at a disadvantage in trying to classify a few of the restaurants, such as ones where I have never been, and Mundial Cocina Mestiza was one of those.  I tried web searches to find their websites or find other sites (e.g. menupages) where I could locate their menus.  In the absence of a restaurant's own website, it's a lot easier to find their address and phone number (and figure out transit information) than to find out what their menu is like for categorization purposes.  From the couple of dishes you mention, it sounds like Mundial Cocina Mestiza is a mixture of global cuisines and influences (as its name implies) in a contemporary vein.  (You would never expect them to be Mexican from the description in their Metromix listing!)  Now that I found their complete menu, I agree - it's hard to categorize, somewhat Mexican but not strictly so, and certainly not your standard &quot;enchiladas and carne asada&quot;.

We had two appetizers, two mains, and two desserts, and all six dishes were pure heaven!  IMHO this is now as good as any Mexican restaurant in the Chicago area.  And that's high praise indeed.  Mundial has a few daily specials in addition to their regular menu.  Note that their regular menu changes from time to time.  Last night's regular menu was quite different from the one on their website, and none of the dishes we had were the same as on the website menu.  The website menu is a good representation to give you an idea of their culinary style and prices.  However, if there is a particular dish there that catches your eye, it's quite possible it won't be on the menu (and conversely, there will be dishes on the menu that catch your eye even though they aren't on the website menu).  Note that their website is now complete with menus for all meals, which it wasn't at the time of my previous post.  One appetizer was steamed mussels; the mussels were fresh and tender and perfectly cooked.  They were mixed with strips of poblano pepper and bacon.  This dish was more than excellent; it was amazing!  The other was tender artichoke hearts stuffed with shrimp and cheese on a bed of spinach.  One main course was grilled sea scallops, served with a side of baked potato stuffed with beans.  The other was the only daily special we ordered, grilled striped bass with spicy green beans, tomato confit, and braised leek.  One dessert was pecan flan topped with herbed mascarpone and a piece of fried plantain on the side.  The other was goat cheese fritters with mango slices.  My descriptions really do not do the dishes justice, either; for example, in addition to the caramelized liquid surrounding the pecan flan, there was also a small amount of a somewhat sweet syrup with tiny flecks of spicy pepper in it.  Every dish was just sublime!  The staff mentioned that they will be offering beer and wine starting in a couple of weeks.  (They served us alcoholic sangria last night.)  Up till now they have been BYOB and I didn't ask whether they will continue to offer that option.  If you love Mexican food, you should really try Mundial Cocina Mestiza.  It's one of our very best.  It's in Pilsen on 18th Street, a block west of Ashland and a block east of the 18th Street station on the CTA Pink Line.

They served very good (albeit conventional) chips and salsa when we were seated.  We started with the sopes, corn masa boats.  The portion size was three and they were happy to provide one of each of the choices (chicken, beef, or chorizo).  All the fillings were tasty, and the chorizo was nicely spicy.  Sopes I had had previously (at Chilpancingo and at Sol de Mexico) were small and golf-ball-sized, also soft and easy to cut, so they were easy to manage.  The bottoms of the ones at Fuego were the shape, size, and consistency of an English muffin.  This was good, in that it meant a lot more to eat; however, they were a bit tough to cut into bite sized pieces (even with the steak knife provided by our server).  I had the tilapia in mole for my entree.  The tilapia was good and the mole was very good.  One note is that there was a lot of mole sauce, which is good if you like mole (I do) but it did tend to overwhelm the taste of the tilapia.  For dessert I had their very good pastel de tres leches.  To drink, I had an excellent horchata early in the meal and a chocolate caliente at the end.  The chocolate was rather weak (i.e. not a lot of chocolate flavor).  All in all, it was a good lunch - tasty food, efficient and friendly service, reasonably priced.  By way of comparison, I think the fish is better at Flamingo's; OTOH I liked the tres leches cake better at Fuego. &#10;" /><attribute name="epoch_seconds" value="1204783200" /></branch><branch><attribute name="name" value="message not name" /><attribute name="type" value="message" /><attribute name="message_id" value="3467460" /><attribute name="author" value="Eat_Nopal" /><attribute name="message_date" value="2008-03-06 15:33:00" /><attribute name="message_body" value="&#10; &quot;One note is that there was a lot of mole sauce, which is good if you like mole (I do) but it did tend to overwhelm the taste of the tilapia.&quot;  FYI... that is the way its supposed to be....

The important thing here is the Fish... and the condiments are merely flavor enhancers.  2)  Saucy... a big puddle of Mole with a bit of meat, vegetables or grains sitting in the middle.  The sauce IS the entree... the rest is just meant as a vehicle for the sauce... and at best it should enhance the sauce.  The Pre-Hispanic definition of Mole is uncannily parallel to India's true meaning of Curry... its a thick amalgamation of many ingredients... where the important thing is the whole and not some central ingredient (as is typically the case in European cuisine).  The saucy approach is more common in areas with deep Agricultural traditions &amp; good land... the important thing is leverage just a little bit of animal based products but the bulk of the cooking involves produce... and usually in a complex amalgamation of flavors.

So this is key.... old school Mexican-American is NOT particularly representative of Mexican... Chicago's Mexican restaurants (beginning with Bayless) are opening many minds as to what Mexican cuisine really is... and I think this is much more powerful than the argument that Chicago has creative Mexican.  With that said... there is clearly some creativity as Bayless and gang adapt to local, sustainable ingredients &amp; stay current with American style presentations they are creating dishes that are different in Form... than what is traditional Mexican.  I can discuss all these differences but the best way to understand it is just to get down to Mexico City, Oaxaca, Puebla, Veracruz etc., and see if for your self.  There is alot of creative, modern cuisine going on in Mexico City... at a level which hasn't crossed the border yet.... mostly because we are busy just trying to establish a truer interpretation of Traditional Mexican... than has existed in the past... with that foundation set... I would expect the Bayless, Bahena &amp; Satkoff's of the world to start doing more creative stuff.... and I see Chicago as the most ripe city in the country for this to happen.

Chicago's Mexican restaurants (beginning with Bayless) are opening many minds as to what Mexican cuisine really is... and I think this is much more powerful than the argument that Chicago has creative Mexican&quot;.  I've been saying it for years that Mexican food in Chicago is Americanized and really closest to what is considered to be Mexican Fast Food.  Yeah, I don't think I ever laid eyes on a burrito both at home or in Mexico during my numerous trips until those late late late night trips to the local Chicago burrito house back in my college years...the burrito house of choice at that time was Arrandas (Yuck) on Division and Ashland as well as the location on Belmont under the el.  I'm sure that many of you remember Arrandas.  We have Bayless, Bahena, and Satkoff...plus a few others, to thank for introducing Chicago and FOOD TV viewers all over to creative and often authentic renditions of traditional Mexican Cuisine. &#10;" /><attribute name="epoch_seconds" value="1205211600" /></branch><branch><attribute name="name" value="message not name" /><attribute name="type" value="message" /><attribute name="message_id" value="3565356" /><attribute name="author" value="gordeaux" /><attribute name="message_date" value="2008-04-05 17:36:00" /><attribute name="message_body" value="&#10; Definitely one to add to this list. &#10;Hey, Amoncada - I finally made it to La Casa Del Pueblo! &#10;And, it was gooood! Muchas Gracias!&#10;The tamales were good. They are pretty close to the ones I make at home. I will say, however, that Tamale Hut Cafe tamales are better than La Casa Del Pueblo's, although THC's product costs a LOT more. A better value is LCDP.&#10;We tried Costillas de Puerco in salsa verde:&#10;I liked the salsa a lot. The meat was a little bit on the salty side for me.  Tinga:&#10;This was WONDERFUL!! The s/o already said we'd be going back for it. I'm not sure it was tinga, the ever so helpful lady at the counter just called it &quot;Pollo in salsa Roja&quot; but it was shredded chicken in a smoky red salsa. Where I'm from, we call this tinga. They had tinga on the menu, so I'm just assuming that was it. It was really, really good.  Pollo en mole:&#10;Not BAD, but kind of uninspired. Probably a mole paste, or some sort of prepared mole. I've had worse. Again, it was not bad at all, better than I thought it would be actually, but nothing mind blowing. Better than 'meh.'  Chiles Rellenos.&#10;S/o was liking these a LOT!. A winner here. S/o is a pretty harsh judge on Chile Relleno, so I owe you a big thank you again.   Definitely will be back, and I urge others to give this place a try. Neat little place for homestyle take out at a very reasonable price. We paid 25.00, and will have enough for three meals at least, and we are decent eaters, trust me. I ordered too much (as usual) because I wanted to try a little of everything.  25.00 got us a dozen tamales, and half pint containers of the tinga, costillas, pollo en mole, rice, and two chilles rellenos. One turn off I normally have to mexican places with stews and soups is the salt content. Didn't seem to be much of an issue here at ALL. Even the tamales were not oversalted.   BIG thumbs up from me,  Amoncada.  Thank you again for letting me (us) know about this little place every time a new thread about Mexican food pops up.

We loved everything we ordered - chiles rellenos, carne asada, pozole (a daily special), and pastel tres leches (another special) for dessert. The PTL was the very best we've had lately.  With the obligatory chips, they bring three delicious salsas to the table.  They are three unique flavors and vary in spiciness, although all are at least somewhat spicy.  One is a pico de gallo type, based on chopped tomatos and cilantro.  The green sauce is tomatillo based.  The star of the show is the red salsa, which is made from guajillo. It has an incredibly full flavor - not just spiciness, but flavor - and is slightly sweet, not sweet like in an Americanized Mexican restaurant, but more like the subtle sweetness you find in mole. It is quite hot indeed, too, hotter than most. It's wonderful.   Also, a note about portion sizes: they're huge. The pozole is a huge bowl, at least a quart of soup if not more. We barely touched it (it's in our refrigerator and will be dinner tomorrow). I ordered the large horchata and it was like a Big Gulp at 7-11, at least a quart and maybe more.   Oh, and the bill for all of this (before tip) was $37 - immensely reasonable.   They don't have a website.

 Tonight four of us had dinner at Mexique, in West Town.  It was excellent!  We arrived on time for our 6:00 reservation and were seated.  Mexique occupies a narrow storefront, so the restaurant is long and narrow - all the more so with the short bar along the left side of the restaurant, which permits only one row of banquette seating alongside it, although the restaurant opens up at the rear where the bar ends.  The room is beautiful, with a d&#233;cor that is warm and contemporary while understated (not at all stark or &quot;in your face contemporary&quot;), with a nice combination of some accent fixtures in bold browns and oranges over a cream-colored background.  It was designed by chef-owner Carlos Gaytan's wife, and she did a great job; it's a gorgeous space.  We started with three appetizers.  The &quot;Pescamal&quot; is a seafood mousse tamal cooked in banana leaves stuffed with crab meat fricassee, with a tomato-based veracruzana sauce.  It wasn't exactly what I expected, but it was excellent nonetheless; what was served was primarily the seafood mousse, with a small amount of crabmeat, no sign of the banana leaves (I assume they were used and removed), and no corn masa layer (at least, not that I could find), with plenty of sauce.  We also had the &quot;Trio of Sopes&quot; - one with escargots and chimichurri butter, one of shrimp provencal with avocado mousse, and the third of sweet plantains, young coconut, and Xico mole.  I loved these!  The only downside was that they were a bit on the small side, but thoroughly delicious.  The mole was strong, similar to mole poblano (black mole), and although it tended to overwhelm the other flavors on that particular sope, the mole was so delicious that that was just fine, in fact, the best of the three (although all three were very good).  The third starter was the &quot;Cochinita Rillettes&quot;, which consisted of achiote/tequila braised pork shoulder rillettes, crostini, purple pearl pickle onion, and rustic celery salad and mango-habanero couli.  I liked this a lot, a nice combination of VERY strong flavors competing with each other in the dish.  The rustic celery salad was actually very spicy/hot, so it stood up well to the tiny amount of equally hot mango-habanero sauce on which the two tiny PPP onions were placed.  If you're keeping score, that makes three appetizers, three winners.  We then had four entrees.  Two of us had the &quot;Costillas&quot;, the braised short ribs with a hibiscus flower glaze, served over a celery root slaw, with truffle oil pomme frites (French fries).  It was EXCELLENT, one of the best short ribs I've had in Chicago.  The way Chef Carlos Gaytan prepares them is, it's a boneless piece of short rib, which he braises, and then puts it on the grill to sear in the hibiscus flower glaze.  This adds a super-thin, crispy layer to the outside of the tender, melt-in-your-mouth short ribs, and it was wonderful.  The meat was slightly fatty but amazingly tender, and full of delicious flavor.  The hibiscus flower glaze was interesting - a very mild flavored glaze, although it was very dark (as dark as mole poblano) and sprinkled with sesame seeds.  The celery root slaw was nice, slightly sweet (perhaps from the cranberries in it and I think there was also a bit of crushed pineapple in there), and the pomme frites were very good.  This was a wonderful dish.  Another entr&#233;e was the &quot;Cordero&quot;.  This consisted of an herb crusted rack of lamb and coffee braised lamb shoulder barbacoa sope, and ratatouille.  This too was outstanding!  While all the components were excellent, I really loved the barbacoa/sope portion.  It was served as a sope, i.e. a corn masa shell the size of an English muffin; piled on top was the barbacoa, which was a lot like a &quot;pulled lamb barbecue&quot;.  Every bite was wonderful!  The fourth entr&#233;e was the roast pork tenderloin.  I forget how this was prepared - some of the dishes match the descriptions on the website menu, others are slightly different, and I forget the specifics on this one, other than that it too came with ratatouille, a slightly different one from the ratatouille which accompanied the cordero.  The pork tenderloin was slightly dry, not terribly so, but a bit, and overall, this particular dish was just okay, not as impressive as the rest of the meal.  So let's call it three entrees, two winners, one just okay.  We split two desserts.  One was the apple tart, with caramelized green smith apples on a puff pastry shell, with a scoop of cajeta and vanilla bean ice cream on top.  This was one of the very best apple tarts you'll find everywhere (I think the Trib's Phil Vettel said the same thing).  The other was the &quot;Enchiladas&quot;, which were crepes filled with chocolate ganache, toasted walnuts, topped with a chocolate sauce, with a scoop of vanilla bean ice cream on the side.  This was good, but a bit on the bland side, one more dish that was just okay.  So two desserts, one winner and one just okay.  Count 'em up, and you'll find we had eight different dishes; six of them were outstanding, and two were just okay.  That makes for an excellent dinner, in my book.  In fact, there were a lot of other dishes on the menu that sounded equally great, and I'd love to return soon to try all the things I didn't get to taste (although it would be hard not to order the short rib again).  The service was excellent; our server, Victoria, was enthusiastic, knowledgeable, and helpful.  Chef Carlos was present in the dining room throughout much of the meal, and we were able to chat with him briefly on our way out, despite the fact that the restaurant was getting quite crowded from about 7:30 on, with a crowd of people waiting at the bar and the host stand.  He was friendly and has every reason to be proud of his restaurant!  The four of us were comfortably full after our three appetizers, four entrees, and two desserts.  Our check, also including three beers ($4.50 each for Negro Modelo), three non-alcoholic beverages ($2.50 each), and tax, came to $43 per person before tip - and that's quite reasonable!  (Note - the Trib review mentioned that bottles of wine are half price on Tuesdays.)   One of the interesting things about Mexique is that it's really a different slant on Mexican cooking from the other creative/provincial Mexican restaurants in town.  Rather than serving provincial specialties in their classic preparations, Chef Carlos has taken provincial Mexican dishes and modified them in creative ways, using the influence of French techniques and ingredients; in some cases, he has also taken classic French dishes and modified them by adding Mexican techniques and ingredients.  All of which has precedent that's both historical and personal, since France invaded Mexico in the 1860s and the army brought with them their chefs and techniques/ingredients, and since Chef Carlos trained at several places including Bistro 110, the French bistro right off the Mag Mile here in Chicago.  The French influence is also where the restaurant gets its name, which is the French translation of &quot;Mexico&quot;.  Chicago is full of excellent Mexican restaurants of all kinds.  Mexique is a lovely space serving outstanding food, and is unique in its combination of French influences with its Mexican menu.  I enjoyed my dinner there and I recommend it!

Even though more creative/provincial Mexican cuisine has grown in popularity recently, there are still plenty of the more conventional Mexican places, featuring the more well-known foods such as enchiladas, carne asada, etc. (Although I have fond memories of La Choza too!) Some of these are listed above under the heading &quot;AUTHENTIC, MORE CONVENTIONAL MEXICAN RESTAURANTS IN CHICAGO NEIGHBORHOODS AND SUBURBS&quot; (although I erroneously listed Mundial Cocina Mestiza in that section - it's a great place, and right now my favorite Mexican restaurant in the Chicago area, but it belongs in the creative/provincial section). Probably the best known, and one of the best, restaurants featuring the more well-known Mexican cuisine is Nuevo Leon, in Pilsen. I really like Jesse's Mexican Grill on North Western Avenue on the far north side of the city; it's not at all fancy, but the food is good and the prices are reasonable.  (I *love* their complimentary guajillo salsa!)  El Tipico in Skokie is another good choice, slightly more upscale though.  I'm sure there are many more good places featuring conventional Mexican cuisine in many city neighborhoods and suburban towns. &#10;" /><attribute name="epoch_seconds" value="1233900000" /></branch><branch><attribute name="name" value="message not name" /><attribute name="type" value="message" /><attribute name="message_id" value="4396166" /><attribute name="author" value="twodales" /><attribute name="message_date" value="2009-02-07 11:38:00" /><attribute name="message_body" value="&#10; Thanks.

 Los Comales has several outposts. I know a few ppl that like them. I've never been enthralled with any of their food - if you find something noteworthy when you go, please report back. I've never heard of kamoosh, but if you are interested in a Oaxacan place, I can think of few as good as:  Taqueria La Oaxaque&#241;a
3382 N. Milwaukee
773-545-858  It has Oaxacan stuff on the menu, but also some other regional styles. I think they do most of their menu quite well.

The similarity to Mundial Cocina Mestiza is striking; the menu at both places is a contemporary bistro version of Mexican food.  Everything was excellent.  My favorite dish was an appetizer of artichoke fritters with a spicy green sauce (I don't remember what kind - tomatillo, maybe?).  I also had the soup of the day, a silky smooth corn poblano chowder.  My entree was an excellent potato-encrusted trout.  My companion had a tasty shrimp in pipian mole (a nutty green sauce).  For dessert I had a chocolate tres leches cake.  Amelia's seems like it's in the middle of nowhere.  It's in the Back of the Yards neighborhood; that stretch of Halsted Street is semi-industrial.  Plenty of on-street parking right in front!  Amelia's is BYOB; there is a large Fairplay supermarket right across the street.  It has a nice selection of beer including many that are in the refrigerator case.  There are some decent wines (red and white) - nothing really high-end, but serviceable enough for most of us (and if you're really into wines, you probably want to bring your own anyway).  One thing to be aware of is that they don't have any of their decent white wines in the refrigerator case. &#10;" /><attribute name="epoch_seconds" value="1277787600" /></branch><branch><attribute name="name" value="message not name" /><attribute name="type" value="message" /><attribute name="message_id" value="6427167" /><attribute name="author" value="nsxtasy" /><attribute name="message_date" value="2011-03-30 20:26:00" /><attribute name="message_body" value="&#10; The folks behind Amelia's are opening a second restaurant in Noble Square this Saturday, as noted in the new Dish column from Chicago Magazine at " /><attribute name="epoch_seconds" value="1301461200" /></branch><branch><attribute name="name" value="message not name" /><attribute name="type" value="message" /><attribute name="message_id" value="6438573" /><attribute name="author" value="nsxtasy" /><attribute name="message_date" value="2011-04-04 12:54:00" /><attribute name="message_body" value="&#10; Amelia's now has its own website: " /><attribute name="epoch_seconds" value="1301893200" /></branch><branch><attribute name="name" value="message not name" /><attribute name="type" value="message" /><attribute name="message_id" value="4608782" /><attribute name="author" value="ms. chow" /><attribute name="message_date" value="2009-04-19 09:05:00" /><attribute name="message_body" value="&#10;" /><attribute name="epoch_seconds" value="1240117200" /></branch><branch><attribute name="name" value="message not name" /><attribute name="type" value="message" /><attribute name="message_id" value="4669050" /><attribute name="author" value="bricap" /><attribute name="message_date" value="2009-05-09 12:57:00" /><attribute name="message_body" value="&#10; A lot of great names mentioned on this list, many I am hoping to try.

They are very gracious, and if they ever make a mistake, they will more than take care of you.  It's also a BYOB, so bring a bottle of Mencia or vinho verde to go with your meal.  The prices are very reasonable, and you will feel like you got away with something after leaving.  It is that good.  Wholly Frijoles&#10;3908 W Touhy Ave &#10;Lincolnwood, IL 60712  &#10;(847) 329-9810  All I can say is good luck getting a table.  They don't need anybody's recommendation, believe me.  This is another great value, and the food is top notch.  The lamb with mole sauce is out of this world.  Another one, a nice cheap eats kind of place:  Huaraches Dona Chio&#10;1547 W Elmdale Ave &#10;Chicago, IL 60660 &#10;(773) 878-8470  Peterson becomes Elmdale east of  Clark.    The specialty here is the huarache, which is like a Mexican pizza.  One really interesting ingredient here is huitlacoche, otherwise known as Mexican truffles.  It grows on the ears of corn.

 We ate dinner at Yolo in Skokie tonight. It was WONDERFUL!!!  Yolo is located in a small storefront in downtown Skokie, a few doors west of Village Inn Pizza, on the side street (Brown). I counted 26 seats, with two booths seating four each, and seven square tables with two of them set for four and the others set for two. The d&#233;cor is pleasantly contemporary and understated.  As we were seated, our server brought us complimentary chips and salsa. The chips were good but fairly standard; the salsa was the first tip-off that this is a very special restaurant! They change salsas from one day to the next; yesterday's was guajillo, and tonight's was piquin, a bright orange, fairly mild salsa that was just superb.  As we perused the menu, we noticed that many of the dishes had unusual sounding sauces. We regretted that we couldn't try everything on the menu, they sounded so good! This chef has a great way with sauces, which make many of their dishes unique.  We started with the Tlacoyitos Veracruz. This reminds me of the corn masa boats (sopes) served as appetizers in some other Mexican restaurants; however, at Yolo, this dish is served over wheat flour-based pancakes rather than corn-based &quot;boats&quot;. There were three: one with steak strips, one with chorizo, and one with mushrooms. They were accompanied by sides of sour cream and a really interesting and spicy/hot tomato pico de gallo. And they were yummy, as good as any sopes I've had in Chicago.  We also had our beverages at this point. Tonight's aguas frutas frescas included jamaica (hibiscus) and pineapple, so I ordered the latter, and it was very good. My companion ordered the Mexican hot chocolate. Compared with others I've had, Yolo's was somewhat mild in chocolate flavor, and they added real vanilla to it, which made it very nice indeed, with the mild chocolate allowing the vanilla to come through. Excellent.  The main courses came next. I had their Oaxaca Mole, which was a chicken breast covered in black mole sauce (mole poblano). The menu says it's &quot;bone in&quot;, but what arrived was boneless. And it was delicious, very moist and flavorful. I'm a big fan of mole poblano, and theirs may be the very best mole poblano I've ever had! It was very spicy/hot, more so than most, and it also had more chocolate flavor than most, but without being overly sweet. My companion had a chicken breast with a pipian (pumpkin seed) sauce that was also delicious, thick, and creamy.  For dessert, they were out of flan, which they normally have; they had two desserts made on site, one an apple crostada that is usually on the menu, and the other a nightly special of plantains or bananas (I forget which) cooked in brandy. They also had a tres leches cake that was bought from a bakery; I ordered the latter and it was actually pretty good, as it turns out.  I really wanted to try some of the other entrees - the salmon in creamy sesame seed sauce, the cochinita pibil, the plantain enchiladas, and a bunch of others - but I'll just have to wait till next time.  Prices are moderate, with entrees in the low teens. They are currently BYOB.  We were chatting with our server; the restaurant is owned by her, her husband, and her uncle. Her uncle is the chef and was formerly an experienced chef at restaurants in Mexico. They decided to name the restaurant Yolo, a shortened and easier-to-pronounce form of &quot;yolotl&quot;, the Aztec word for heart. They hope to have their own website up within a month. Yolo is open six days a week starting at 12:00 noon for lunch and dinner, closed Sundays. (We looked at the lunch menu before leaving and it sounded pretty good, but the most creative dishes with the most interesting sauces were those on the dinner menu.)  Yolo has been open for four months. Right now it reminds me of Mixteco Grill before they expanded - a very small restaurant with a very talented chef serving amazing Mexican food, the kind of place that you just KNOW is going to get more and more business as word of mouth spreads, that will eventually need a bigger space. They're actually doing pretty well already; about half the tables were occupied when we were there tonight, on a cold winter weeknight. This is a true neighborhood gem, and a convenient option for anyone who lives in the northern suburbs. Try it and I bet you'll share my enthusiasm for it!  Yolo Mexican Eatery

One important thing to note, however: the restaurant was fully booked with advance reservations this evening (a Saturday) and they were turning away potential walk-in customers without reservations.  The three of us split two appetizers: the Tacos Mulin chaai, soft-shelled tacos of shredded chicken with their mole negro, just wonderful, and a repeat performance of the Tlacoyitos Veracruz (see above).  For mains, I had the chiles rellenos, and I had them substitute their wonderful mole negro for the sauce (for an extra $2 charge, that's fine with me). The chiles were interesting; the peppers were your standard poblanos, but the ground beef filling on one included some small pieces of diced carrots and potatos rather than the more common rice, and the chicken filling was chicken finely shredded. It was an excellent dish. My companions had the pork tenderloin in a creamy poblano pepper sauce, served with mixed vegetables and sweet potato puree, which was okay although somewhat mild and maybe a bit overdone, and a repeat of the excellent chicken breast with pipian sauce (see above).  We skipped dessert in favor of their delicious Chocolate Con Leche (hot chocolate), which I really love (see above; the balance of the somewhat mild chocolate with the added vanilla is phenomenal).  This was another wonderful dinner, and for an extremely reasonable price (the bill for the three of us was $78 including tax, before tip). The ability to BYOB added to the value.

Dessert was a small chocolate mousse with a goat's milk center.  It's a very small place (44 seats) a few steps down from Broadway.  They get very busy even during the week.  They take a small number of reservations but try to keep some of the place available to walk-in traffic from the neighborhood.

Several of us ate there (Rustico Grill) last night.  It was very good.   The menu's resemblence to Mixteco Grill was obvious.  There were several standout dishes.  I loved the uchepos gratinados, which were slightly sweet corn tamales.  For the main course, I loved the mahi-mahi; the red pepper almond sauce on it was exceptional.  In fact, all of the sauces were exceptional.  We ordered the side dish of &quot;moles&quot;, which consisted of three sauces (mole negro, mole verde, and a red pumpkin seed mole); they were great, although the sauces the dishes came with were also good, so we had a lot of great sauce, maybe should have ordered more chips to put them on.  The flan del dia was coconut, and this was another exceptional dish, with just a subtle hint of coconut and a very nice creamy texture.  Misses: the rack of lamb was way WAY underdone, even the second time, after we had sent it back; and the pastel de tres leches was rather dry for this usually-moist dish.  And a note: the calamari appetizer was in the form of a salad, so the calamari itself was lukewarm, not hot.  Service was spotty; it took a while for the server to show up to take our food orders, and the entrees arrived when we were just finishing our appetizers.  The place itself is delightful, with a contemporary Mexican decor that reminded me of Mexique, outdoor sidewalk seating, and large windows that were open on this pleasant evening.  (Note the interesting gourd-based chandelier in the main room.)  All in all, the food was mostly excellent, and it was an enjoyable dinner.

Some background:&#10;- In both NY and Philly, I have lived in neighborhoods with great food choices, with a particular emphasis on great local food markets/specialty shops, as going out is less of a top priority than everyday stuff. &#10;- For those who are familiar with those places, in NY I lived near Atlantic Avenue in Brooklyn, giving me access to amazing Middle Eastern grocers, Smith St/Cobble hill restaurants and Italian specialty shops (I moved away before Trader Joe's arrived in that area). In Philly I live near the Italian Market, with great Italian and Mexican groceries, a plethora of Vietnamese grocers and restaurants, cool bars/small independent BYOBs, etc.&#10;- Farmer's markets are a plus too.  thanks! &#10;" /><attribute name="epoch_seconds" value="1301893200" /><branch><attribute name="name" value="message not name" /><attribute name="type" value="message" /><attribute name="message_id" value="6437789" /><attribute name="author" value="bricap" /><attribute name="message_date" value="2011-04-04 09:09:00" /><attribute name="message_body" value="&#10; My top two food neighborhoods are Lincoln Square and Andersonville. &#10;" /><attribute name="epoch_seconds" value="1301893200" /></branch><branch><attribute name="name" value="message not name" /><attribute name="type" value="message" /><attribute name="message_id" value="6437832" /><attribute name="author" value="mountsac" /><attribute name="message_date" value="2011-04-04 09:27:00" /><attribute name="message_body" value="&#10; 1. Lincoln Park / Lakeview area: great diversity of non-chain restaurants, pastry shops.  Good number of ethnic restaurants (Japanese, Thai, etc), Italian restaurants, and contemporary American.  I know you care less about special occasion places, but it just so that Lincoln Park has several of the city's best destination restaurants.  The crowd is a bit younger / yuppy.    2. Wicker Park: this neighborhood is quickly transforming.  Many exciting contemporary American restaurants, ethnic restaurants, and pastry.  It's smaller, but it's dense and diverse. I don't know if you care, but both this neighborhood and the Lincoln Park / Lakeview area afford some of the most exciting night life in Chicago.  The crowd here is decidedly young and hip.    3. Old Town: There is a number of good ethnic restaurants here.   But for me the real plus of this place is that it is affordable but still very close to all the places in Gold Coast, River North, and Streeterville (in which are quite expensive to live but fun to eat).    4. Argyle/Berwyn/Edgewater area: this is a stretch of several neighborhoods farther from the city, but still convenient with the red line.  The residents are older and/or ethnic (because of the cheaper real estate), although it is getting younger.  It has the city's old Swedish neighborhood (there are some Swedish eateries still), Southeast Asian neighborhood, Middle Eastern neighborhood.  Needless to say, ethnic food is ubiquitous and authentic (the best area for Middle Eastern and Vietnamese in Chicago). &#10;" /><attribute name="epoch_seconds" value="1301893200" /></branch><branch><attribute name="name" value="message not name" /><attribute name="type" value="message" /><attribute name="message_id" value="6438050" /><attribute name="author" value="igorm" /><attribute name="message_date" value="2011-04-04 10:24:00" /><attribute name="message_body" value="&#10; Linc0ln square/ German, Greek, Serbian, Croation, Polish, Mexican,and Korean ethnic foods available in the area, not tomention Indian and Pakistani very near. &#10;" /><attribute name="epoch_seconds" value="1301893200" /></branch><branch><attribute name="name" value="message not name" /><attribute name="type" value="message" /><attribute name="message_id" value="6438545" /><attribute name="author" value="nsxtasy" /><attribute name="message_date" value="2011-04-04 12:48:00" /><attribute name="message_body" value="&#10; There's a HUGE discussion about this question, and even though it's a few years old, all of the information in it is still accurate:  Best Chicago Foodie 'Hood - " /><attribute name="epoch_seconds" value="1301893200" /></branch></branch></branch></branch></tree>
