Good variety of traditional Korean dishes, barbeque, and soups. Clean restaurant, usually pretty busy but has a parking lot which is key. Pretty good dol sot bi bim bap. Good naeng myun (cold noodle soup) as well.\nIn the Northwest Suburbs:\nCho Dang Tofu, on Algonquin Rd near Dempster in Mount Prospect (they have a website for directions, and another restaurant in Naperville). They basically specialize primarily in a very spicy tofu soup called soon du bu which is served boiling hot. Very very good. Clean, simple restaurant, but small. Good bi bim bap.\nJigol Jigol (not sure of the English spelling), southeast corner of Roselle and Golf Rd in Schaumburg. Specializes in BBQ right at the table. We like it for the self-serve table for side vegetables that you grill with your meat. They have an all-you-can-eat special that is good if you have 4 people or more. New place, kind of chi-chi but definitely authentic. Feels more like Korean restaurants in the NYC/NJ area.\nKoreana - Salem and Golf Rd in Schaumburg - a little divey but they've renovated recently, our favorite dol sot bi bim bap. They also have good large casserole dishes served on table top pots for 2 or more.  Have been to Jin Ju -- it's not bad, but it is kind of Americanized Korean food in how the food is prepared and served, to be honest. \n",

Not sure they do a good job of advertising themselves, but the Korean menu there is very good, especially if you're into the fried stuff - gambonkgee is really good and crispy there, and their ja jang myun and jamboong are both quite good too. Even the ool-myun is good. One non-Korean dish we love there is the salt and pepper fried squid -- you see that dish more on the east coast than here in the midwest. All the wait staff are Korean, even though it's technically a Chinese restaurant (they have separate Chinese and Korean menus).  The Chinese fare is pretty standard stuff.  Great place to take kids because it's big, very clean (because it's maintained by the Radisson; used to be a steakhouse restaurant) and spacious -- and seemingly never busy, at least on the weekends (we hear they keep busy during the week with Korean Air Lines flight attendants and pilots who are on layovers). \n",

It's owned by the cutest couple who work there every day..   The place is filled with Korean diners (always a good thing when in a Korean restaurant!) and the prices are very reasonable.   Along with their many side dishes, they also serve up a free veggie pancake and a fried fish for each person.  Don't let the looks of the fish fool you because it is absolutely delish!  You ask why I say THE BEST bi bim bop?  Once you finish the bibimbop, underneath, is the most delicious crispy rice \"crust\" that just slips out easily from the bowl for that final delicious blow..  In fact, there have been times when I couldn't finish the bibimbop and had to scoop it out onto my plate just so I could attack the crispy rice crust below.  Not sure what they do to their bowl, but this is the only Korean restaurant I've ever eaten this dish at where you don't have to jackhammer the crust out.    Enjoy! \n",
